<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Some two years ago the author commenced collecting memoranda of
mechanical and practical information pertaining to the care and
operation of steam engines and boilers, with a view of forming a
systematic digest.</p>

<p>Being an employee of the J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co. for a number
of years my attention was called to the constant inquiry for a book of
this description from young men mechanically inclined and those running
farm engines and small steam plants.</p>

<p>By repeated assurance that there was great need for such a work, and
by ready and valuable assistance from personal friends and experts in
mechanical engineering, I have considered it advisable to publish a
practical guide for young engineers.</p>

<p>The aim has been to place the information contained in the book in the
most simple and compact form, and while it is not intended for the
education of the more advanced engineers, the instructions given will
be found practical in the operation of steam plants of any size. It is
more especially intended for the instruction and guidance of young men
learning to run engines, and those operating farm engines and small
plants, whose experience has been limited.</p>

<p>After carefully considering the mode of presentation, it was thought
best to adopt the form of a catechism, with the questions and
answers so set forth as to resemble an ordinary conversation; also
to illustrate and give a minute description of the construction and
function of the different parts used in the building of engines and
boilers.</p>

<p>While the greater part of the information is new, parts have been
compiled from Power, Roper and other mechanical papers and books,
simplified to meet the required aim, for which due acknowledgement is
here given.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HINTS TO PURCHASERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>In selecting an engine of whatever style, or for whatever purpose it
is very important to get not only a good one, but one that is of the
proper size. Do not entertain the mistaken idea that it is best to have
a larger engine than is required (so that it will do its work easily),
as an engine which is too large for the work required is very wasteful
both of fuel and water. An engine always gives the best results when it
has a fair load.</p>

<p>In the selection of a farm or traction engine you should look carefully
to the arrangement of the driving gear, the manner in which the engine
and the traction wheels are attached to the boiler, the convenient
arrangement of the throttle lever, reverse lever, steering wheel,
friction clutch lever, independent pump (if used) and injector for easy
operation from the footboard, as the easy control of all these parts by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
the engineer saves much time and annoyance and in many instances may
prevent accident which might prove disastrous to both life and property.</p>

<p>Always purchase a boiler with sufficient capacity to allow a small
margin beyond its ordinary requirements. Be sure and have the boiler or
boilers properly set so that the best results may be derived from the
fuel burned. Many good boilers are condemned because they do not steam
well on account of bad setting.</p>

<p>If a locomotive style of boiler, see that it has a large fire box (well
stayed) and a sufficient number of flues to allow of easy firing and
good combustion of the fuel without being obliged to use a forced draft.</p>

<p>If a return flue boiler see that the main flue is of sufficient size
and of the required ⁵/₁₆ inch thickness of material; also that it has a
mud drum and from four to six hand-holes (the more the better) both top
and bottom for the purpose of keeping the boiler free from scale and
becoming mud burnt and unsafe.</p>

<p>Remember there is no advantage in carrying low steam pressure in
boilers as it is more economical to carry high pressure rather than low.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
The average boiler pressure should be about 80 lbs. per square inch,
which is not too high for safety, nor too low for economy of fuel.</p>

<p>The purchaser must use his own discretion as to the style of engine
he prefers, a horizontal or vertical, side or center crank, as all
styles are extensively used with equally good results. It is purely a
matter of preference depending, of course, largely upon space or room
available for stationary engine.</p>

<p>Do not make the mistake of deeming that any kind of a foundation will
answer for a stationary engine. It should be built by a skillful
mason in every case and hard brick or stone and cement used in its
construction. The best is always the cheapest in the end.</p>

<p>An engine or boiler should never be put in a dark corner or damp
cellar, rather place them when possible in dry well lighted rooms and
so arranged that every part can be reached when necessary without
trouble or delay. Walls and floors should be kept clean and a good
supply of oil cans, wrenches, waste and whatever tools are needed
should be kept in their proper places.</p>

<p>The purchaser of a traction engine should see that it has a Friction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
Clutch as an engine with a clutch is much more practical, convenient
and safe to handle upon the road than one without a clutch. The matter
of brackets, braces, gearing, traction wheels, axle, the manner in
which the engine is mounted upon the boiler should be well considered
as there are many kinds and styles, all of which have their merit “more
or less.” Your own judgment should be used as to the style wanted after
thoroughly studying the various kinds.</p>

<p>Do not make the too common mistake of thinking a cheap engineer is
the man you want. The engine and boiler are important factors in the
success of your business and no matter how simple and strong they
may be it will pay you to put them in charge of a competent engineer
who is capable of taking the proper care of them. For a small plant,
or traction engine, it is not necessary to have the highest grade of
ability, as there are several grades among engineers; but it is better
to pay a suitable man for competent and faithful work than to pay for
what may happen through the neglect or incompetency of one whose only
recommendation is that he is <i>cheap</i>.</p>

<p>Do not be deceived by imposters claiming to be first-class engineers,
who, the first thing they do, to substantiate their claims, alter the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
engine in some way that only deranges it. Be watchful of this and see
that such men do not tamper with the valves and adjustments of the
engine, which are always set properly before it leaves the factory.</p>

<h2 id="DUTIES" class="nobreak">DUTIES OF ENGINEERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>The duties of an engineer are of much more importance and require
a better knowledge of the operating of machinery than is generally
understood. The responsibilities that rest upon him are very great;
this applies to all engineers, but more especially to inexperienced men
who take charge of small plants or farm engines, whose knowledge of
machinery and the dangers connected with the improper handling of it,
is limited. The proper management of boilers and engines is of as vital
importance to prevent accident as their proper construction; as they
are liable to get out of order and become unsafe unless the engineer is
sufficiently informed to know what precautions should be taken under
any and all circumstances that might prove disastrous.</p>

<p>Not only should an engineer be ever on the alert to guard against
accident, but he should also be capable of keeping the engine, boiler
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
and appliances in good condition, as the life of the machinery depends
largely upon his competency and the faithful performance of his duties.</p>

<p>An <span class="smcap">Engineer</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">Should be sober.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should be industrious.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should be careful.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should be faithful to his charge.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should keep his engine and its surroundings neat
and clean.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should keep his engine running smoothly without
knocks or pounds.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should learn to let “well enough” alone.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should never attempt experiments unless he knows
what he is about.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should have a place for everything and keep
everything in its place.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should show by the quietness in running and
appearance of the engine in his charge that it is properly cared
for.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should constantly endeavor to expand his mind as
to the management, construction and care of boilers, engines and their
appliances.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Should carry this book in his pocket for

<h3>HORIZONTAL TUBULAR BOILER.</h3>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is a horizontal tubular boiler constructed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It has a cylindrical shell, with heads riveted
at each end, in which are placed a large number of tubes, 4 inches or
less in diameter. It is set in brick work, with the furnace at one end,
beneath the shell. The products of combustion pass under the boiler
its full length and return through the tubes or flues to an up-take at
the front end. It is furnished with a man-hole beneath the flues, and
hand-holes for cleaning, and generally has a steam dome.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What are the advantages of a horizontal
boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It is simple in form, easy to construct,
requires bracing only on the flat heads, which are sustained their
greater part by the tubes, generates a large amount of steam for the
space occupied, and is not difficult to keep clean with fairly pure
feed water.</p>

<h3 id="LOCO_B" class="space-above1">LOCOMOTIVE BOILER.</h3>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is a locomotive or fire box boiler constructed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The ends of a cylindrical shell are continued
straight down upon the sides, and enclosed to form a rectangular
structure in its lower <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg
17]</span> portion and conformed to the curvature of the cylindrical
shell at the top. In the rectangular portion is secured a fire box,
separated from the sides and ends by water spaces called “water legs,”
and having its top which is called the “crown sheet” about the center
of the cylindrical shell. An opening is formed in both sheets in rear
end of the fire box door frame. The cylindrical shell has heads riveted
at both ends. These heads have numerous flues open at both ends put in.
All the flat surfaces are stayed to each other at suitable intervals,
and the crown sheet is stayed from the shell. The fuel is thrown in
through the door at the rear, and the products of combustion are
conveyed to further extremity through the tubes or flues. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
furnished with hand-holes for cleaning and a steam dome. There are two
different styles of fire boxes on Locomotive Boilers, the round bottom
fire box in which the water circulates under the grates, and the square
open bottom fire box. Both kinds are used extensively.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What advantages have the locomotive or fire box boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It is entirely self-contained, generates steam very rapidly,
is economical in space, and needs no elaborate foundation.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What disadvantages has the locomotive or fire box boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Expensive first cost, and difficulty in cleaning,
especially where impure feed water is used.</p>

<h3 id="RET_FLUE" class="space-above1">RETURN FLUE BOILER.</h3>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Describe the construction of a Return Flue Boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It has a cylindrical shell, with heads riveted at each end,
in which are placed a large main flue, and a number of small flues or tubes,
open at both ends. The top row of flues is placed below the water line.
One end of the main flue is used for the fire box, into which the fuel
is thrown through door at back end and the products of combustion pass
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
forward through this main flue to an ample smoke box in front end, and
return through the smaller flues or tubes to smoke box at rear end,
which is connected to the smoke stack. They are generally supplied with
steam dome and mud drum, and are used extensively in the construction
of traction engines where straw is used for fuel. They are also
furnished with several hand-holes placed in proper places for cleaning
the boiler.</p>

  <p class="f120 space-below2">Sectional View J. I. Case Return Flue Boiler.</p>
</div>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What are the advantages of this style of boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Large heating surface, easily repaired and cleaned,
simplicity of construction and compactness.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>REYNOLDS CORLISS CONDENSING<br />
AND NON-CONDENSING ENGINE.</b></p>

<p>This engine has a massive, peculiarly constructed frame, being cast in
two parts. The forward part contains the main pillow block bearing, and
the part in which the cross-head runs is cylindrical in shape, and has
bored Guides, and large lateral openings.</p>

<p>The crank is a large disc plate, and the large heavy fly-wheel serves
the double purpose of a drive pulley and balance wheel.</p>

<p>The cylinder is supplied with four valves, two at the top and two at
the bottom, and directly upon the bore of the cylinder. The two at the
top are the steam valves, the two at the bottom are exhaust valves, and
receive their motion from a single eccentric acting through the medium
of a wrist plate or vibrating disc, from which the valve connections
radiate. The valve being independently adjusted, the commencement,
extent and rapidity of the movement of each can be most accurately
arranged. The steam valves are controlled by the Governor, which, being
very sensitive to the variation of load, allows just the required
amount of steam to enter the cylinder to keep up the uniform speed.
The exhaust valves being at the lower ends of the cylinder, at the
clearance space, the water of condensation is allowed to escape in
the most thorough manner, without the use of cylinder cocks or other
devices.</p>

<p>This style of engine is intended for all purposes, but is especially
adapted to heavy and continuous work and where the conditions call for
an engine capable of working under a high steam pressure, also when the
work is of an intermittent character.

</div>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is a Vertical Tubular Boiler generally constructed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A cylindrical fire box set into the lower part
of a vertical cylindrical shell, the space between forming an annular
“water leg.” An opening is formed in both sheets for the fire door. The
top of the fire box serves as a flue sheet for numerous tubes or flues
which extend <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
through the closed top of the outside shell, and through which the
products of combustion pass to the smoke stack. The upper portions of
the tubes are surrounded by steam.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&emsp;Where this style of boiler is made for marine
purposes, the upper part of the tubes is submerged, and is called a
submerged-flue boiler.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What advantages has the vertical type of
boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Minimum floor space, portability, low cost of
setting, and a wide allowable variation in the water level.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What disadvantages has this type?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Liability to leakage in the exposed upper ends
of flues where they are not submerged, deposits from impure water in
the “water leg,” in small sizes insufficient heating surface, though
the latter fault can be corrected by making the boiler very tall. Some
of the very large vertical boilers are remarkably efficient.

  <p class="f120 space-below2">Stirling Water Tube Boiler.</p>
</div>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is a water tube boiler constructed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The Stirling Water Tube Boiler as illustrated,
has three upper or steam domes, the steam space of all of which is
connected, while the water space of the two front domes is connected.
All of these three domes are connected with a lower or mud drum, which
is not bricked in, but is left free to expand and contract.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&emsp;The three upper domes are supported on wrought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
iron beams, which are entirely free and independent from the brick work. The
feed water enters the rear upper dome, and descends gradually to the lower
or mud drum, being heated in its descent by the escaping gases to a
sufficiently high degree to cause precipitation in the mud drum of all
of the solid or scale bearing matter that the feed water contains.
The water then in the front bank of tubes is chemically pure, and all
danger of scale reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What advantages have the water tube boilers?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. One of the great advantages of this style of
boilers is its distinct circulation, being up the front bank of tubes
across from the front upper dome to the middle dome, down the middle
bank of tubes to the lower or mud drum, and up again the front bank of
tubes, and so on in circuit. It also has great steaming capacity, and
is economical in fuel. Steam is taken from the middle dome.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&emsp;This marked circulation is a desideratum in
boiler practice, and the Stirling may be said to be the first that has
accomplished it to so great a degree.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What disadvantages have the water tube boilers?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Expensive first cost of setting them up in brick work.

upon and is securely bolted to two saddles. The rear saddle also
supports the two outer bearings for the crank shaft.</p>

<p>The engine frame is cast in one piece, cylindrical in shape, with
bored guides for cross-head, and has large lateral openings. It forms
the front cylinder head at one end, and contains the two pillow block
bearings at the other.</p>

<p>The cylinder is overhanging and self-lining.</p>

<p>It has the locomotive type boiler, with open bottom fire box, covered
with an ash pan, and has a steam dome at front end. The outer shell
of this boiler over fire box extends beyond the back head. To this
extension is bolted the two brackets containing the bearings for the
main axle and cross shaft.</p>

<p>The traction wheels are of the wrought rim steel spoke type, with high
mud cleats bolted diagonally across the entire width of tire.</p>

<p>The front axle is supplied with a ball-bearing bolster, which supports
the front end of boiler. The engine has the <a href="#I_116">Friction Clutch</a>, Link

<h3 class="space-above1">QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS,</h3>

<p class="f150 space-below2">concerning the operation
and care of steam boilers.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is steam taken from the boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By suitable piping leading from a steam dome on top of boiler.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a steam dome and how is it made?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A steam dome is cylindrical in shape, is made usually of boiler
plate flanged and riveted over a hole on top of boiler.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Of what use is a steam dome?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Its use is to afford space for dry steam to collect.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a mud drum, and of what use is it?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The mud drum is cylindrical in shape, made of boiler iron flanged
and riveted over a hole on under side of boiler, in which mud and
sediment may collect, and is of great value on a return flue boiler.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What are boilers furnished with so that they may be easily cleaned?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Man-holes and hand-holes.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What are man-holes and hand-holes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The man-hole is a hole cut in boiler large
enough to admit a man and is covered by a portable plate which can be
fastened absolutely tight. Hand-holes are small holes cut in boiler in
convenient places into which a hose can be placed and the boiler washed
out and the mud and scale removed. Hand-holes are covered with portable
plates which can be fastened absolutely tight.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How can a boiler be protected from the cold?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By a non-conducting jacket which keeps off the cold, retains the
high temperature of the boiler and prevents the radiation of heat.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What materials are used for jacketing a boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Plaster, wood, hair, rags, felt, paper and asbestos.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How are they applied?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Wood is put on in long strips close together
like barrel staves, fastened with hoops and usually covered with sheet
iron. The other materials are put close to the boiler and held in place
by sheet iron or canvas. They are sometimes put on with an intervening
air space between them and the boiler.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the use of air space?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It protects the material from being burned
or otherwise injured by the heat.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is there no radiation through these coverings?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, but the loss is very slight, as the temperature
of covering should never rise above what just seems warm to the hand.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should you feed water to a boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Continuously during the whole time that steam is being used.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Will a steam pump feed continuously?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, by running the pump faster or slower according
to the amount of water required.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why is a continuous feed preferable?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Because it maintains the water in the boiler
at a uniform level and gives the most perfect action.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should precaution be taken in choice of
water used in the boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes. Always use water that is as clear and free
from foreign matter as can be procured, rain water preferred.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the result of using impure water?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It will form a scale upon the flues and plates
on the inside of boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What harm does scale do?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. In the first place scale is a non-conductor
and prevents the heat of furnace from producing its best effects upon
the water and in the second place it allows the plates and flues to
become over heated and burn.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How can you prevent the formation of scale?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. There are numerous compounds upon the market
some of which are known to be very reliable, but for ordinary purposes
sal soda dissolved in the feed water answers very well.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What precaution should be taken in the use of
sal soda?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Great care should be taken that too much is
not used at a time. If too much is used a great deal of trouble will be
caused by the water in the boiler foaming.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How often should a boiler be cleaned?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It depends entirely upon the condition of
the feed water used and the amount of service exerted from it. It may
vary from once or twice a week to once in two or three months, or even
longer.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Does a boiler only require the regular cleaning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No, it should be blown off three or four times
a day by the surface blow-off.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should the surface blow-off be left open any
length of time?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No, only a few seconds at a time, say from
fifteen seconds to a minute, even longer on larger boilers, but the
engineer must use his own judgement in this matter.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What does the surface blow-off do?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It blows out all the impurities that arise in
the form of scum on the surface of the water, thus lessening the amount
of scale formation.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should a boiler be cleaned?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By blowing the water out at a low pressure of
steam and after cooling off wash out and scrape the inside, removing
all scale and sediment.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you blow off your boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By means of a blow-off valve situated at the
bottom part of the boiler.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When should a boiler be blown off?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. When the steam pressure entirely disappears
and the water is at boiling point, if boiler is set in brick work.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why not blow off under a full head of
steam?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Because when blown off under pressure there is
heat enough remaining in the shell and flues to bake the scale upon the
interior, thus rendering it exceedingly difficult to remove.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. In what condition is the scale after blowing
off at low pressure.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Some may be baked hard and attached to the
flues and shell, but the greater part will be soft and slushy so that
it can be easily removed.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is this slush removed from the boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. If a fire box or return flue boiler, all the
hand-hole plates should be removed and as much of the slush as possible
raked out; then a hose is inserted and a stream of water forced in
which will carry the remainder out. The hose should be placed in the
top holes first.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is it a good idea after blowing off a boiler
to fill it with water again without delay?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. Because the boiler is hot, and if cold
water is put in before it is thoroughly cooled off the boiler will be
subjected to severe strains caused by the sudden contraction of the
metal that is expanded by the heat, which will injure it to a greater
or less degree.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p class="f120"><b>GARR-SCOTT TRACTION ENGINE.</b></p>

<p>This engine, as will be seen by examining the cut, is of the Side
Crank, Side Gear style, the engine of which is mounted upon a long
heater, to which the cylinder and the main pillow block bearing are
attached, and is supplied with the bar or locomotive guides for
cross-head.</p>

<p>It is fitted with the Link Reverse peculiar to their own style of
manufacture, also <a href="#I_084">Injector</a>, <a href="#I_116">Friction Clutch</a>,
<a href="#I_090">Cross-head Pump</a>, <a href="#I_076">Governor</a>, Syphon for filling Tank on front end,
Automatic Sight-Feed <a href="#I_080">Lubricator</a>, and large Foot Board with Tool Boxes attached.</p>

<p>The boiler is of the locomotive or round bottom fire box type, with
dome on front end, and is mounted upon the traction wheels with axle
arms attached to the sides of boiler, which are supplied with springs.
The front axle is attached to the boiler with a bolster arrangement,
which is also supplied with a spring.</p>

<p>The traction wheels are made practically in one piece, having the
spokes cast in both hub and rim, the cast iron rim being chilled faced,
with the mud cleats cast on.</p>

<p>The smoke stack is supplied with a screen suitable for burning either
wood or coal. It has a patent steering attachment, the hand wheel of
which is on the same side of engine as the band wheel.</p>

<p class="space-below3">The engine and boiler are supplied with all
the necessary fittings to make them convenient and safe with proper
handling.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When should a boiler be filled after being
blown off and cleaned?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A boiler should not be filled under any
circumstances until it is about the same temperature as the water used
to fill it.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How are the hand-hole plates put back in
position?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The plate that covers the hole is put on the
inside of the boiler and held in position against the plate by a bolt
attached to it and passing out through a yoke which straddles the hole
upon the outside and serves as a brace against which the bolt acts.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is a leak prevented?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By placing packing between the hand-hole plate
and the boiler plate.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the best kind of packing to use for
this purpose?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Two or three ply sheet rubber is the best, cut
in the form of a ring to fit the bearing surface of the plate.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Can any other material be used?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, hemp or cotton packing. When this is used
it should be pulled out in fine shreds and thoroughly oiled before
putting in position. Use as little as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Do the metals need any preparation?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, all the old packing that may have burned
on the metal should be thoroughly scraped off, also the scale should be
removed from the vicinity so that the packing will have a smooth and
even surface to bear against.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How are man-hole plates put in position?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. In the same manner as the hand-hole plates.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is required of an engineer or fireman in
the care of a boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. He should watch carefully all the parts
that are exposed to any steam and see that they do not become unduly
weakened by corrosion or accident. All the working parts and fittings
should be examined daily and be repaired or replaced as soon as they
show signs of wear or weakness. The <a href="#I_099">steam gauge</a> and <a href="#I_101">safety valve</a> should
receive constant care and both should be tested frequently, the one
by the other, and the steam gauge by a standard in order that it may
be known to be in perfect order. When scale forming water is used the
feed pipe should be frequently uncoupled and examined and all sediment
removed. The check valve should be examined frequently to see that it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
seats properly so that water cannot leak from boiler in this way
and the utmost care should be taken in regard to the consumption of
fuel.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. In case of accident how should an engineer
conduct himself?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. With the utmost coolness.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. If the water gauge glass breaks, what should
be done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The upper and lower gauge valves should be
closed immediately.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Can a new glass be put in at once?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No, because a new glass is cold, and if put in
position and steam turned on, the sudden heat and expansion would be
apt to crack it.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When can a new glass be put in?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. After the boiler has been cooled off.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is to be done in the meantime?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The boiler must be run by the use of the gauge
cocks alone.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is to be done if the gauge cocks leak?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. If the leak is in the seat, that part should
be taken out and re-ground and refitted. This should be done at
once.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What harm is done by a leaky gauge cock?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It allows the water to run down over the face
of the boiler, which tends to corrode it.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When the leak is where the gauge cock is
screwed into the boiler, what is to be done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. As soon as the boiler is cooled down examine
and see if the gauge cock can be screwed up another turn. If so try
that, then if the leak is not stopped the gauge cock must be taken
out and a new one put in its place, or the thread of the old one so
repaired that there will be no leak.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why not screw up the leaky gauge cock when the
boiler is under pressure?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Because there is great danger of breaking the
cock, thereby placing the engineer or fireman in great peril.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What should be done in case a gauge cock is
accidentally broken off?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Open the furnace door and if possible
partially bank the fire, close the damper and allow the water to blow
out at the hole until steam alone comes out. In the meantime get a
piece of soft pine six or seven feet long and whittle down one end
until it will about fit and jam it into the hole. Work it around
until the jet of steam is stopped. Fasten <span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span> the stick in temporarily and stop the
engine if not already done. It will now depend on the condition of the
break and the position of the surrounding parts as to the means to be
employed. The stick should be cut off short and firmly driven into the
hole and braced or tied securely. The engineer or fireman must use his
own ingenuity for this work.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Can a boiler be worked in this condition?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, by the use of the gauge glass to
determine the level of water.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should a boiler be run in this condition
continually?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. A new gauge cock should be supplied as
soon as possible.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When a gauge cock becomes stopped up what
should be done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. After steam is down, the front or outer part
may be taken off and a stiff wire run into it to open the clogged
tube.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is it simply necessary to get the wire
through?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No, the wire should be worked back and forth
until all the deposit or scale is thoroughly cleaned out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. In case the steam gauge gets out of order what
should be done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. There should always be an extra gauge on hand
that may be put to use. If there is no extra steam gauge, the engine
should be shut down until the gauge can be repaired.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why not continue running by using the safety
valve?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Because it is very dangerous and should never
be attempted.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How much variation from the actual pressure
can be allowed on steam gauge before it is repaired?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. None. As soon as suspected of being even
slightly out of order it should be repaired.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. In case the pump does not work what should be
done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Supply the boiler by the injector.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is to be done where there is no
injector?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. First, care should be taken that the water in
the boiler does not fall below the second gauge cock or out of sight in
the gauge glass, then stop the engine and bank the fire. When this is
done, examine the packing around the plunger to see that it does not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
leak air, then examine the valves of the pump to ascertain whether they
are worn and leak. If this be the case they must be reseated at once.
If the valves are all right, work the pump and open the side valve in
the delivery pipe to see if the pump draws water. If no water appears,
the trouble is probably in the suction pipe.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How can this be remedied?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. First examine the strainer at end of suction
pipe or hose to see if it is stopped up; if it is, clean it out and
try the pump. If it works, the difficulty is remedied. If the strainer
is clean, examine the pipe or hose from end to end to see that it is
perfectly air tight; if not, it should be made so.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. If the delivery pipe is choked, how can it be
cleaned?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Close the globe valve next to boiler, and then
examine the check valve to see if it is all right. If it is choked or
filled with sediment, take out the valve, clean the shell and re-seat
the valve; if the check is all right, disconnect the pipe and clean out
if necessary.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What if this pipe and check valve are all
right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Let the boiler cool off, then blow off
the water, disconnect the pipe between check and boiler, where the
difficulty will probably be found, and clean thoroughly.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How can check valve and delivery pipe be
choked with water that has already passed through the injector or
valves of the pump?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The water may contain quantities of lime which
are deposited from the heated water upon the interior of the pipe,
which will thus be gradually decreased in size until the hole is too
small to answer the purpose.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When the communication between the water gauge
and boiler is interrupted, what should be done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The glass should be blown out frequently
by opening the drip cock at the bottom, then shut the upper valve,
allowing the water to blow through the lower valve until the water runs
free and clear. Then shut the lower valve and open the upper one and
blow through in like manner.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. In case of low water what should be done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Cover the fire quickly with fresh coal or damp
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
ashes, close the lower draft door, and allow the furnace to cool. Never
dash water into the furnace to check the fire, it is dangerous.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why not draw or dump the fire?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Because it would result momentarily in
stirring up an intense heat, cooling can be effected more rapidly by
covering the fire and checking the draft.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should the pop or safety valve be opened?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. Never let more steam out of the boiler in
this condition than can be avoided.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should the engine be stopped or the throttle
valve be closed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. A sudden stoppage of the outflow of steam
will cause the water level to fall. The first thing to be looked after
is to subdue the heat which is the source from which trouble may
arise.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should the feed water supply be turned on?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. <i>Leave it alone.</i> Should the pump or
injector be running, the water level will be recovered gradually as
the boiler cools down. If the feed is not on, the sudden admittance of
water on the overheated surfaces will cause a disaster. The feed should
not be turned on until sufficient time has been allowed to avert such
danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Are there any appliances by which to guard
against accident from low water?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes. Alarms to call attention by blowing a
whistle or ringing a bell when the water is below a certain level. Also
fusible or safety plug placed in the heating surface of boiler most
liable to be overheated from lack of water.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Of what use is the safety valve?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. To prevent the accumulation of pressure above
a given point.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should water be left in the boiler when not in
use?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. It is better to draw out all the water and
properly clean the boiler before leaving.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What should be done in case a grate bar breaks
and drops out of place?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. If no other bar is at hand, it might be
repaired with a heavy stick of wood.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How can this be done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By cutting the stick in such a shape as to fit
the space made by the broken bar, then cover with ashes before the fire
spreads over it.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Will the stick burn out?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What harm would result from firing for a short
time without the bar?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. None to speak of to furnace or grate bars, but
the quantity of air admitted to the fire box would make it exceedingly
hard to keep up steam and the hole thus made would cause a great loss
of fuel.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What should be done if a bar in a rocker grate
should fall out?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Take a piece of flat wrought iron and cut it
to fit the bearings, this will do for some time and will not interfere
with the rocking of the bars. Or, take a heavy piece of plank, covering
the opening completely, and cover the plank carefully with ashes,
surrounding it on all sides to protect it as much as possible from the
fire.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Will not this latter prevent the rocking of
the grate?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, and it can only be cleaned by raking out
from underneath.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should such difficulties be avoided?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A good engineer will always have on hand at
least two or three extra grate bars.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should a boiler be forced beyond its normal
capacity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Never force a boiler beyond its normal
capacity, as such excessive firing distorts the fire sheets and results
in leaks and fractures.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should intense fires be started in or under
boilers?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Never build an intense fire in or under a
boiler until the shell is well heated. Hot fires in or under cold
boilers hurry their destruction.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>CAUTION.</b></p>

<p>Never blow out the boiler under high steam pressure or fill it again
with cold water when the boiler is hot, as either one of these is
likely to fracture the transverse riveting and is dangerous.</p>

<p>Do not feed the water to the boiler irregularly. The slower the
water goes through the heater the more heat it takes up. To fill the
boiler to three gauges and then shut off the feed until the water
level is again down, the exhaust steam, after it has heated the water
standing in heater, passes off without leaving any of its heat, and
then turning on the feed water again much faster than needed, the
water has not time to take up so much heat as if the feed were slow
and regular. Much bad effect on the boiler is due to the difference in
temperature at the time when the feed is off and on.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CALKING FLUES.</h3>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. In case the boiler flues become leaky, can they be tightened?</p>

<p class="neg-indent space-below2">A. Yes, by the use of a tool
called an “expander,” which is generally kept in stock by the boiler
manufacturer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Can an unskilled person expand and tighten the
flues of his boiler without the aid of an expert or boiler maker?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, if he is careful and follows
these instructions, viz:</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;First clean the ends of the flues and flue
sheet of all dirt, soot and cinders, and place the expander within the
leaky flue, being careful to have the shoulder of the tool well against
the head and end of flue. Now, with a light hammer drive in the taper
expanding pin and after two or three blows of the hammer, jar the pin
out, turn the expander a little and drive in pin as before, removing
the pin and turning expander again until a full turn has been made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Great care must be taken in expanding flues
not to expand them so hard as to stretch or enlarge the hole containing
flue in the flue sheet, thereby loosening the adjoining flue. After all
the loose flues have been carefully expanded, take the beading tool
and place the long or guide end within the flue, then with the aid of
a light hammer the ends of flues can be gradually beaded or calked
against the flue sheet, rendering them perfectly tight. With a little
practice, a careful man can do a neat job of calking, thereby avoiding
loss of time and expense in being obliged to call a boiler maker. An
expander and calking tools should be among the tools of every engineer,
as many little leaks that may occur in a steam boiler, although they
may not be dangerous, give it a bad appearance and should be calked and
stopped by the engineer.</p>

<h3 id="CLEAN_FLUE" class="nobreak">CLEANING FLUES.</h3>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How are boiler flues cleaned?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. There are two ways of cleaning flues, viz:
with a steam blower and a scraper. The latter is more commonly used and
when properly applied does its work most efficiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;The scraper is screwed on the end
of a rod of sufficient length to allow it to pass through the flue,
and when cleaning, the scraper should be passed forward and backward
through the flue or least two or three times, to insure all the soot
and ashes being removed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="f120 space-below2">Wilson Pat. Flue Scraper.</p>
</div>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;The cleaning of flues should be done
systematically, as often as required to keep them clean, as clean flues
not only add greatly to the steaming capacity of the boiler, but make a
great difference in the amount of fuel used.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;If the flues are allowed to become
covered inside with soot and ashes, the formation of which becomes a
non-conductor for heat, the product of combustion passes through the
flues without leaving more than one-half as much heat as it would
otherwise leave if the flues were clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">BLOWER.</h3>

<p><b>The Blower</b> consists of a small pipe attached to the steam dome
or top of the boiler with a globe or angle valve, and is situated
near the stack. This pipe enters the stack just above the boiler, the
end being bent up toward the top of stack and reduced to a very small
opening. When steam is turned on through this pipe, it displaces the
air in the stack, causes a partial vacuum in the smoke box, and the
air rushes through the grates, fuel and flues to replace that which is
blown out by the blower, and the draught can be increased as much as
desired.</p>

<h3 id="EX_NOZZ" class="nobreak">EXHAUST NOZZLE.</h3>

<p><b>The Exhaust Nozzle</b>, as generally constructed, is an elbow
attached to the end of the exhaust pipe in the smoke box or smoke stack
of the boiler, the end of which points upward, with the opening reduced
so that the exhaust steam will be forced up the stack, and thereby
produce the same effect as a blower.</p>

<p>The opening in the exhaust nozzle should never be made so small as to
check the exhaust steam to any great degree, and cause back pressure in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
the cylinder, as the power of the engine would be diminished. The
opening should be as large as possible, and still produce sufficient
draught to keep the required steam pressure.</p>

  <p class="f120">Lunkenheimer<br /> Fusible Plug.</p>
</div>

<p><b>A Fusible Plug</b> is a short brass bolt which has a hole
running through its center, filled with a metal that melts at a low
temperature. This plug is screwed into the crown sheet directly over
the fire, and as long as it is covered with water the metal will not
melt and run out; but should the water become low, exposing the crown
sheet to the intense heat of the fire, the metal will run out, and the
steam rushing through the hole puts out the fire and many times saves
the crown sheet from injury.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. In what condition would the plug become useless and of no value?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By allowing it to become covered on the inner end with
scale and sediment. It should be unscrewed and occasionally examined, at least
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
two or three times during the season, and all scale and dirt removed
from the end of the plug before replacing. Examine the crown sheet to
see that no scale has formed over the hole to prevent the water from
reaching the plug.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How can a plug that has melted out be refilled?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Unscrew the plug from crown sheet and cap one end with
clay, then melt the lead or babbitt metal in a shovel, spoon, or even a piece of
bent sheet iron, and refill the plug. Now, with a light hammer, close
the ends tight, and screw the plug into the crown sheet.</p>

<h3 id="LOW_WATER" class="nobreak">LOW WATER ALARM.</h3>

<p>A low water alarm is an instrument attached to a boiler, and so

<p>It is made in three main varieties: The Pedestal Engine, the Bracket
Engine, and the Hanger Engine. The illustration represents the <a href="#I_058">Pedestal type</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
the upright frame of which is cast in one piece, and encloses and
protects the principal moving parts, its lower part being a reservoir
for oil, into which the crank-pin dips at every revolution, affording a
simple and efficient means of lubrication.</p>

<p>The piston is connected directly with the crank shaft, thus doing
away with the cross-head, wrist-pin and guides. The piston being thus
connected at one end to the crank-pin, it travels back and forth at its
other extremity through the bore of the cylinder. The latter by reason
of its shape is free to turn in its casing, and is therefore rocked by
the vibrating piston rod through an arc sufficient to open and close
the steam and exhaust ports on its face.</p>

<p>The cut-off valve is of the plug type, and receives its motion from
the shaft cut-off governor, attached to the balance wheel.</p>

<p>The center crank shaft runs in two large bearings which are bolted
securely to the side of the frame. Access to the inside of the frame
can be had by taking off the plates from either side.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">STEAM ENGINES.</h2>
</div>

<p>All styles of engines both large and small should receive proper
attention. All the vibrating and moving parts should be kept well
oiled and free from grit and dirt. If this is neglected, the friction
of the moving parts will soon wear away the metal and induce pounding
and cause what is called “lost motion,” which detracts greatly from
the power of the engine, and if allowed to run in this condition will
soon necessitate large expense for repairs and shorten the life of the
engine.</p>

<p>Tighten all the boxes as they wear, being careful not to get them
too tight. Keep the piston rod and valve rod well packed with a good
quality of soft packing. Keep the valve or valves set properly to give
the required amount of lap and lead and an equal cut-off at the end of
each stroke whether working in full gear or notched up.</p>

<p>Keep the cross-head shoes fitted properly in the guides, being careful
to keep the piston rod in line. If the above instructions are followed,
your engine will run smoothly and do good service.

<h3 id="STEAM_CYL" class="nobreak">STEAM CYLINDER.</h3>

<p><b>The Steam Cylinder</b> is that part of an engine in which the piston
travels; it also contains the steam and exhaust ports and is one of the
most expensive, as well as essential, parts of an engine. The cylinder
should be made of the best quality of cast iron, and the greatest care
taken in boring it perfectly true and round. It should be counter-bored
at each end to allow the piston in its travel to overlap at the end of
each stroke. Without the counter-bore, a shoulder would be formed at
both ends of the cylinder as it became worn by the piston rings, which
in time would cause a knock or pound at the end of every stroke; the
only remedy being to have the cylinder re-bored.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Special attention should be paid to keeping the cylinder well oiled
with the best quality of cylinder oil to prevent it from being cut by
the piston rings. If allowed to run dry and cut, it will cause no end
of trouble.</p>

<p>The size of cylinder is not always the measure of the power of the
engine. The power depends upon the heating surface of the boiler and
steam pressure; as the piston speed can always be increased, by running
the engine faster, until the maximum evaporating capacity of the boiler
is reached.</p>

<h3 id="PISTON" class="nobreak">PISTON AND ROD.</h3>

<p><b>The Piston</b> is another very important part in the construction of
an engine, and it conveys the power of the steam to the crank. It is
composed of a piston head, on which are placed the piston rings held in
position by the follower plate, and is securely attached to the piston
rod. Great care should be taken in the construction of the piston rings
to have them fit the cylinder perfectly tight, at the same time to have
the least possible friction. Piston rings should always be made of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
softer metal than the cylinder so that the greater part of the wear
will be upon the rings instead of the cylinder, as the rings can easily
be replaced.</p>

<p>There are a great many kinds of packing for piston rings, but the most
commonly used at the present time are the steam packing rings. The
character, accuracy in construction and condition of the piston make
a great difference in the quantity of fuel consumed and the amount of
power developed by the engine.</p>

<p><b>The Piston Rod</b> connects the piston to the cross-head and is
generally made of steel. Where the piston rod enters the cylinder, a
steam tight joint is obtained by the use of a soft, pliable packing
placed in the stuffing box, and held in position by the stuffing box
gland.</p>

<p>This box is kept packed just tight enough to prevent leaking, by
drawing up the stuffing box gland when required. This can be repeated
until the packing is all used up, when box must be repacked.</p>

<h3 id="STEAM_CHEST" class="nobreak">STEAM CHEST.</h3>

<p><b>The Steam Chest</b> contains the valve, and can be on either side
of cylinder as may best suit the style of engine. Steam is admitted into
the steam chest, and passes into the cylinder by the action of the valve.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Many engine builders cast cylinder and steam chest in one piece, while
others cast them separately and bolt them together. The only advantage of
the former over the latter is the absence of one less joint to keep packed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="f120">Steam Chest and Plain Slide Valve.</p>
</div>

<p class="space-above2">The steam ports are the two openings through
which the steam is admitted to the cylinder.</p>

<p>The exhaust port is the opening through which the exhaust or waste
steam passes out of the cylinder.</p>

<h3 id="VALVE" class="nobreak">VALVE.</h3>

<p>There are a great many kinds of valves used on steam engines, namely,
the Corliss, Slide, Rocker, Balance, Rotary, etc., but the one most
commonly used on farm engines is the plain slide valve, which has been
generally adopted by all the larger engine builders in this country. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
is simple in design, and when properly set does its work very
efficiently. They are less complicated than others and are easily set;
they are made in many different designs, but the principle of each is
the same.</p>

<p>The slide valve is constructed to slide upon the smooth surface of
the valve seat, in which are contained the two steam ports for the
admission of steam to each end of the cylinder, and also the exhaust
port through which the exhaust or waste steam passes out of the
cylinder.</p>

<p>The slide valve is operated by the eccentrics, which are attached to
the main crank shaft of the engine and revolve with it, the object of
the eccentrics being to move the slide valve back and forth upon its
seat to admit the steam alternately through the steam ports to the
cylinder.</p>

<p>The valve gear is a most important detail and one upon which the
economy of fuel in a great measure depends, and any derangement in this
part of an engine causes an immediate increase in the fuel consumed and
decrease in the power of the engine.</p>

<p>In a properly constructed valve the slide upon the seat should be
reduced to the smallest possible amount, and should be so designed as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
to give an equal cut-off and release at both ends of the cylinder,
whether working full gear or notched up.</p>

<p>The engine should also have the same power
whether working forward or backward, and the
cut-off should be as sharp as possible.</p>

<p>The more perfect the valve gear the more the
engine can be notched up, and thus allow the
steam to expand in the cylinder to its utmost.
The engine which can be notched up the most is
the most economical in fuel and water.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-above2"><b>The Cross-head</b> is of cast iron and
connects the piston rod to the connecting rod, and is that part of an
engine where the motion is changed from vibrating to rotary. The piston
rod is fastened securely to it, while the connecting rod is attached by
wrist-pin. On a V guide or bored guide engine frame the cross-head is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
supplied with adjustable shoe slides that can be adjusted to take up
their wear and fit the guides properly, also to keep the piston rod in
line. On a bar or locomotive guide engine the cross-head is adjusted by
removing the liners from between the bars.</p>

<h3 id="ENG_FRAME" class="nobreak">ENGINE FRAME.</h3>

<p><b>The Engine Frame</b> is the large casting which contains the bored,
V shaped or locomotive guides for cross-head shoes. It also contains

all answer the same purpose.</p>

<h3 id="CONN_ROD" class="nobreak">CONNECTING ROD.</h3>

<p><b>The Connecting Rod</b> on an engine is the connection between
the cross-head and crank-pin; it is generally made of wrought iron
or steel, with brass boxes at each end held in position by wrought
straps. These straps are attached to the connecting rod by gibs and
keys. Connecting rods are sometimes made with mortised ends to receive
the brass boxes, which are held in place by wedge block and adjusting
screw. The latter style is used principally on the larger makes of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
engines. While the connecting rod with mortised ends are considered a
little the safest, the straps on the ends of rods are most commonly
used. The brass boxes at ends of connecting rod are adjustable to take
up the wear by use of the gibs and keys, and they should be adjusted as
frequently as there is any lost motion discovered at the crank-pin or
cross-head, which will be indicated by a knocking or pounding as the
crank passes over the centers.</p>

<h3 id="CRANK" class="nobreak space-above2">CRANK.</h3>

<p><b>The Crank</b> is that part of an engine by which the effect of the
steam acting against the piston is converted into work. There are two
kinds, Side and Center crank. The term Side crank refers to a disc
plate or a crank attached to one end of a shaft and in which is placed
the crank-pin. When the shaft extends to the right the engine is called
a right hand engine, and when it extends to the left it is called a
left hand engine.</p>

<p>The term Center crank refers to a shaft with the crank in the center,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>

well balanced. It is optional as to which gives the best results as
both kinds are used upon all sizes of engines.</p>

<p><b>The Crank-Pin</b> connects the connecting rod and crank. It is made
of steel, and special care should be taken to keep the crank-pin well

pin and boxes. If once allowed to become cut, it will be impossible to
prevent it from heating.</p>

driving or band wheel is placed between one of the traction wheels
and the boiler. The necessary fittings are furnished with both boiler
and engine to keep them in good running order and perfectly safe if
properly handled.

<h3 class="nobreak">LINK.</h3>

<p><b>The Link</b> is that part which holds the link block and is
connected at each end to the eccentric rods; it is used only on
reversing engines. The link is made on a curve, so that when the link
block is at either extreme end the valve is operated to its full
movement. When the block is in the center of link, the valve covers
both ports and prevents the ingress of steam to the cylinder.</p>

<p><b>The Link Block</b> is attached to the slide which connects it to the
valve rod. The valve rod connects the slide and valve, and where it
enters the steam chest is packed in like manner to the piston rod.</p>

<h3 id="REV_LEV" class="nobreak">REVERSE LEVER.</h3>

<p><b>The Reverse Lever</b> is that part of the valve gear connected with
the link for raising and lowering it, thereby changing the travel of
the valve and reversing the motion of the engine. When the reverse
lever is placed in the center notch of quadrant, the lap of slide valve
should cover both steam ports, preventing any steam from entering the
cylinder, thus stopping the engine. In moving this lever from the center
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
notch, it either drops or raises the link as the case may be,
increasing the travel of the valve and allowing steam to enter the
cylinder. When the reverse lever is thrown into the outside notch of
quadrant at either end you get full travel of the valve which gives
full power of engine, providing you have sufficient steam pressure.</p>

<h3 id="ECCENTRICS" class="nobreak">ECCENTRICS.</h3>

<p><b>The Eccentric</b> on an engine is for the purpose of moving the
valve back and forth upon the valve seat and has a throw equal to the
travel of the valve. The throw of eccentric is caused by the wheel or
plate being bored to one side of its true center, and generally equals
one-half the travel of the valve. If more or less, the difference is
caused by the use of rocker arm or similar devices for increasing or
diminishing the throw of eccentric as the case may be. The eccentric is
accurately fitted and fastened to the main shaft of the engine with set
screws or key.</p>

<h3 id="ECC_STRAP" class="nobreak">ECCENTRIC STRAP.</h3>

<p><b>The Eccentric Strap</b> is that part of the engine in which the
eccentric revolves, and is attached to link by the eccentric rod. It
should be kept well oiled to secure a free and easy movement to the link.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>On reversing engines there are two eccentrics exactly alike, one
connecting with upper end of link, the other with lower end by the
eccentric straps and rods. In this case the eccentric rod that is
moving the valve is the one nearest to the link block. When the lever
is in the center notch the link is also in the center of its travel.
In this case, both of the eccentric rods move an equal distance and
the link vibrates back and forth, but as the block is in the center
it gives no motion to the valve, and as the valve, having sufficient
lap, covers both ports when the lever is in this position prevents the
ingress of steam to the cylinder, consequently no motion.</p>

<h3 id="ECC_ROD" class="nobreak">ECCENTRIC ROD.</h3>

<p><b>The Eccentric Rod</b> connects the eccentric to the link, two being
used on a reversing engine. On a simple engine only one eccentric rod
is used and is connected to a rocker arm which is attached to the valve rod.</p>

<h3 id="WOOLF" class="nobreak">WOOLF VALVE GEAR.</h3>

<p><b>The Woolf Valve Gear</b> is used in connection with an engine to
reverse its motion. It is arranged with one eccentric attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
crank shaft the strap of which has a long arm cast on, to which the
eccentric rod that moves the valve is attached. This arm is also
supplied with a roller, which runs in a slot on a rocking head. This
head is held in position by a box and is connected to the reverse lever
by a rod. By throwing the reverse lever to either end of the quadrant,
the position of the rocking head is so placed that the roller in the
slide operates the eccentric strap, rod and valve, and the engine will
run in the direction desired. By throwing the reverse lever to the
opposite end of the quadrant, the position of the rocking head is so
changed that it will reverse the motion of the valve, and the engine
will run in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The Quadrant being notched, the point of cut-off can be regulated with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
the reverse lever, according to the load; by placing it in the last
notch in quadrant when full power of engine is required, or notching it
up when doing light work, the same as with the link reverse gear.</p>

<h3 id="GOVERNOR" class="nobreak">GOVERNOR.</h3>

<p><b>The Governor</b> contains a valve so constructed and connected with
the weighted balls that an increase of speed of the engine throws out
the balls, which raises the arms attached to valve rod, thereby closing
the valve and thus decreases the flow of steam through the governor
valve and reduces the speed of engine until the governor balls are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
again in their true position. Now, when the speed decreases and the
weighted balls rise above their true position, the valve opens, allows
more steam to enter the cylinder and the speed of the engine increases
until the engine is again running at its proper speed.</p>

  <p class="f120">Gardner Governor.</p>
</div>

<p>Governors are used to regulate the quantity of steam required to run an
engine at a uniform speed under variation of load, and to run properly
they should be kept perfectly clean and free from the accumulation of
gummy substances caused by using inferior oil, which has a tendency to
interfere with the free and easy movement of the different parts.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. If you desire to run your engine faster or
slower with the throttle valve wide open, how can it be done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Some makes of governors are provided with
regulating screws at the top; by turning the hand nut in one direction
you lengthen the valve stem and reduce the steam opening in the
governor valve, which reduces the speed.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;To increase the speed of the engine
the handle nut is turned the opposite direction, which shortens the
stem and increases the opening in governor valve, allowing more steam
to enter the cylinder and the speed is proportionately increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;The <a href="#I_076">Gardner Governors</a> are provided
with a hand screw at the side for regulating the speed, as will be seen
by examining the accompanying cut. It also has a Sawyer’s Lever for
opening the valve to its full extent, and a belt tightener.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Will the handle nut stay in position after
once being set to a certain speed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Not unless the check nut directly over the
handle nut is screwed down tight to prevent the stem from changing its
position.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is a governor liable to cause trouble and fail
to govern the engine properly?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. All governors are more or less delicate in
construction and must be kept clean and well oiled, the belt must not
be allowed to slip, nor must it be so tight as to cause the governor
to work hard. The small stuffing box that packs the valve stem should
never be screwed down steam tight, as it causes too much friction on
the stem and prevents the balls from operating it, and the engine will
run unsteadily and spasmodically. Always allow the stuffing box to leak
a little, then you know it is not too tight.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;First class governors may sometimes be condemned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
for not regulating the engine to a uniform speed, when a good cleaning,
oiling or loosening of the valve stem stuffing box nut would allow them
to work perfectly.</p>

<h3 id="AUTO_OIL" class="nobreak">AUTOMATIC OILER.</h3>

<p><b>An Automatic Oiler</b> is used on an engine to keep the cylinder,
piston and valve lubricated, and is most essential for the safety and
easy operation of these parts. It works automatically and is supplied
with a glass tube through which the oil can be seen passing into the
cylinder. The feed can be regulated to allow just the required amount
of oil to pass into the cylinder.</p>

<p>Where a sight-feed automatic oiler is used on an engine there can be no
excuse whatever for the engineer to allow the cylinder to run dry and
cut, as he at all times can see whether oil is passing into it or not.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you fill an automatic oiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Close valves D and E, open valve G to draw
off the water. Close valve G and take out filling plug C, fill A with
oil and replace plug C, then open valve D, and the flow of oil to the
cylinder can be regulated with valve E.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Will the oil feed as soon as the oiler is
filled?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No; time must be given for sight-feed glass
and condensing chamber to fill with water of condensation.</p>

to receive the oil discharge pipe of oiler and put oiler in place.
Then tap the steam pipe about 18 inches if possible above the top

<h3 id="INJECTOR" class="nobreak">INJECTOR.</h3>

<p><b>An Injector</b> is an automatic machine attached to a boiler, for
injecting or forcing water into it and at the same time heating the
water to a very high temperature, which saves fuel and prevents the
danger of sudden contraction of the plates and flues. It can be used
independently and is indispensable on a farm engine.</p>

<p>In piping an injector to boiler, use as short and as straight pipes
as possible and especially avoid short turns. Take steam directly from
boiler, and have a globe valve in steam pipe close to injector; have
the water suction or supply pipe independent of any other connection,
and it must be supplied with a globe valve close to injector. This pipe
and connections must be absolutely air tight; the slightest leak will
cause trouble. The discharge pipe to boiler must be supplied with a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
tight and reliable check valve. If valve leaks, the injector will
become hot and cause no end of annoyance. It is a good plan to put a
stop valve between check and boiler in discharge pipe, so that check
valve maybe taken off and repaired, or a new one put on without loss
of time. A foot of straight pipe screwed into the overflow assists in
starting an injector, especially at low pressure.</p>

   <p class="f120 space-below2">American U. S. Injector.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you start an injector to work?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. To start an injector, open the suction valve wide, then
open steam valve. If water appears at the overflow, close and open quickly the
suction valve, opening only about ¼ of a turn if at low steam pressure,
and one turn or more if at high steam pressure, regulating the water
supply according to steam pressure. The injector is controlled entirely
by the valve in suction pipe, or by the suction lever after the steam
is turned on.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Will an injector work with hot supply
water?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. An injector will not work if the water that is
delivered from the tank is too hot to condense the steam.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What are the principal causes of an injector
not working accurately?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Leak in suction pipe, supply cut off by
strainer being clogged, loose lining inside the hose, leak in the stem
of valve, too little steam pressure to lift, dirt in the tubes, red
lead blown or drawn in through steam or supply pipe, bad check valve,
not lift enough or none at all, new boiler full of grease, wet steam,
obstruction in the connection to the boiler.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;If injector fails, examine at all
of these points before condemning. The most common trouble is a leaky
suction.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;In describing the method of
connection and operating an injector the foregoing may have to be
modified in some instances, as there are a great many different kinds
and styles of injectors which operate and connect differently, but the
above if followed carefully and with a little discretion will be found
useful.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Bear in mind, however, that the
injector does not start to work to boiler as soon as it gets the water.
At first the water will run out of the overflow. At this point you
start the injector working to the boiler by closing and opening the
water valve as quickly as possible <i>with a jerk, or as nearly with
one motion as you can</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you find the maximum and minimum
capacity of injectors?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Injectors are controlled entirely by the
suction valve after steam is turned on. To find the maximum capacity of
an injector after starting, gradually open the suction valve in supply
pipe until steam “breaks” and water comes out of the overflow, then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
start the injector again and you will know about how far the suction
valve can be opened without causing the “break.”</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;To find the minimum capacity of the
injector, manipulate the suction valve in the same manner in exactly
the opposite direction.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>DIRECTIONS FOR OPERATING<br /> WORLD INJECTOR.</b></p>

<p>See that the injector is shut off when put on, by turning the handle
as far to the right as it will go. To start, turn handle to the left
one-quarter turn; when the water appears at the overflow, turn the
handle slowly to the left as far as it will go, and the injector will
be working to the boiler.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
if the handle is turned a little less than a quarter of a turn, until
the water appears at overflow—then start to boiler as before.</p>

<p>If you have valves in steam and suction pipes, be sure and open them
before starting.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How high will an injector draw its supply?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. About twenty feet is the limit.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How hot does an injector deliver water?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. From 150 degrees to 200 degrees, according
to the steam pressure and the proportions of its capacity at which
injector is working.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should the jets be cleaned when they
become scaled?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By soaking in diluted muriated acid, about one
part acid to ten parts water.</p>

<h3 id="THROTTLE" class="nobreak">THROTTLE.</h3>

<p><b>The Throttle</b> on an engine is the valve which allows the steam to
enter or be shut off from the cylinder and should always be left wide
open on a governor engine when running, as the governor regulates the
quantity of steam required to run it at its proper speed and is much
more economical.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span></p>

<h2 id="STEAM_PUMP" class="nobreak">STEAM PUMP.</h2>
</div>

<p><b>An Independent Steam Pump</b> is virtually an engine with two
cylinders, one for the steam piston, the other for the water piston or
plunger, and is used in connection with a steam boiler for supplying it
with water. The discharge pipe of a pump is generally connected with a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
feed water heater of some sort, which heats the water to a high
temperature before entering the boiler, though there is a late pattern
of steam pump which delivers the feed water to the boiler at about the
same temperature as the injector. The cylinder of steam pump should
always be well oiled before starting in the morning and stopping at
night. The stuffing boxes on piston and valve rod should in all cases
be kept well filled with soft and moist packing. If the packing is
allowed to become dry and hard, it will cut the rod, inducing leakage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
and necessitating repairs. When a steam pump is not in use in cold
weather all the drain, drip and pet cocks should be left open, to
allow the water to run out. While most farm engines are furnished with
an independent steam pump, some are equipped with what is called a
cross-head pump.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p id="CROSS-HEAD_PUMP"><b>A Cross-Head Pump</b> is operated by a plunger
attached to the cross-head of engine and has two valves, a supply and a
discharge valve, also is supplied with an air chamber. This style of pump
is available only when engine is running. Engines with a cross-head pump
should always be supplied with an injector to be used in case of
failure of pump to work and while engine is shut down. The cross-head
pump is connected to the heater in the same manner as an independent pump.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How high will the steam pump lift water?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A steam pump will lift or draw water about 33
feet, as with one inch area, 33 feet of water will weigh 14.7 lbs., but
the pump must be in very good order to lift 20 feet and all pipes must
be absolutely air tight. A pump will give better satisfaction lifting
from 10 to 15 feet. No pump however good will lift hot water, for the
reason that as soon <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[Pg
92]</span> as air is expelled from the barrel of the pump the vapor
occupies the space, thereby destroys the vacuum and interferes with
the supply of water. When necessary to pump hot water, place the pump
below the supply, so that the water will flow into the valve chamber.
Always have a strainer at lower end of suction or supply pipe. A pump
should be set up so that it is accessible for inspection, cleaning and
repairs, and so that the shortest and straightest suction and delivery
pipes can be used.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">MARSH STEAM PUMP.</h3>

<p><b>The Marsh Steam Pump</b> is so constructed that the exhaust steam
may be turned into the suction, thereby condensing its exhaust steam
and returning it with its heat to the boiler, thus heating the feed
water to a high degree.</p>

<p>The pump is automatically regulated and can never run too fast to take
suction, or should the water supply give out when the throttle valve is
wide open no injury can occur to the moving parts.</p>

<p>The steam valve, though nicely fitted, moves freely in the central bore
of the steam chest, and has no mechanical connection with other moving
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
parts of the pump, but is actuated to admit, cut off and release the
steam by live steam currents which alternate with the reciprocation of
the piston.</p>

<p>Each end of the valve is made to fit the enlarged bore of the steam
chest, and it is due to these large valve heads, which present
differential areas to the action of steam and the perfect freedom of
the valve to move without hindrance from other mechanical arrangements
or parts, that the flow of steam into the pump is automatically
regulated.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>DIRECTIONS FOR SETTING UP<br /> AND RUNNING.</b></p>

<p>Before connecting the steam pipes, blow out with steam pressure the
chips and dirt in the steam pipes. Always use the union furnished with
the pump. It has a gauze gasket in it to catch the dirt that may get
into the valve. Before starting pump, open air cock in delivery pipe
and turn exhaust lever back, away from the air chamber. Then open
throttle valve wide and allow pump to exhaust into the air until it
takes suction, when deflecting lever may be thrown forward toward air
chamber and cold water in the pump will condense the exhaust and return
it to the boiler.</p>

<p>If pump refuses to work, the difficulty is to be looked for in the
valve chest. Do not take off the chest. The valve may be taken out and
cleaned but <i>never</i> filed. <i>The valve must be returned through
same end as taken from.</i> Before closing, be sure that the head is
screwed tight on the valve, using the socket wrench furnished.</p>

<p>When the pump is stopped, pull the exhaust lever back, so the condensed
steam from leak of throttle valve will not go into the pump. It is safer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
also in cold weather to take off head of water end. Slight but constant
lubrication adds much to the regular working of the pump. Be sure there
are no leaks in the suction pipe, and when water is raised more than 10
feet, a foot valve should be put in. Compress the packings on piston
rod as little as possible and yet prevent the escape of steam. Before
leaving the pump in cold weather, break the suction and allow it to run
empty for a minute with all the cocks open, then be sure the throttle
valve is closed tight. When necessary, pack the joints under the steam
chest, side plate and air chamber with manilla paper or thin rubber.</p>

<h3 id="HEATER" class="nobreak">HEATER.</h3>

<p><b>The Heater</b> is used on an engine in connection with a boiler
for heating the feed water before it enters the boiler under steam
pressure. It is usually constructed of a shell of cast or boiler iron
into which live or exhaust steam is admitted. This shell usually
contains a series of pipes or a coil of pipe, through which the feed
water is forced by the pump, the water thereby being heated to a high
temperature before entering the boiler.</p>

<h3 id="STEAM_GAUGE" class="nobreak">STEAM GAUGE.</h3>

<p><b>A Steam Gauge</b> is an instrument used for indicating in pounds
the amount of steam pressure upon each square inch of surface of the
boiler. It is very delicately constructed, and should not be tampered
with after once being set to indicate correctly. If a steam gauge is
found not to indicate the exact pressure in the boiler it should be
sent to the factory for repairs. Never attempt to repair it unless all
the appliances for so doing are at hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>A steam gauge should always be placed on a boiler with a syphon, or by
tying a knot in the pipe between it and the boiler, so that the steam
may condense, thereby allowing the water to operate it. If steam is
allowed to enter, the heat would tend to expand the tube in the gauge
and it would indicate more than the real pressure.</p>

<p>A steam gauge is usually constructed with a hollow, flat tube, called
the Bourdon spring. This tube is bent in a simple curve and fastened
at one end, the other end is free and by a simple clock work actuates
the pointer which indicates upon the dial the steam pressure per square
inch upon the boiler.

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What should be done in case the steam gauge
becomes defective?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. When the steam gauge has become broken by
freezing or otherwise, and there is none on hand, the engineer may run
by setting the safety valve so that it will blow off within from ten to
fifteen pounds less than it is ordinarily set at, and then by careful
firing, run until a new gauge can be procured, which should be done
without delay.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Some engineers have been known to
make a practice of running without a steam gauge.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Would you recommend this method?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No, it must be resorted to only in case of a
sudden accident and where shutting down would cause great loss. Every
engineer should have an extra steam gauge on hand, to be used in case
of accident to the one in use.</p>

<h3 id="SAFETY_VALVE" class="nobreak">SAFETY VALVE.</h3>

<p><b>Safety Valves</b>, or pop valves, as they are sometimes termed, are
made in many different kinds and styles, but the one most commonly used
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
on a farm engine is constructed with a coil spring, which is
adjustable, to allow the valve to pop off at a certain pressure. When
the pressure exceeds this amount, it raises the valve from its seat and
allows the surplus steam to escape. It should be set with the steam
gauge, to allow a little margin of steam pressure over that which is
necessary to drive the load, and should be compared with the steam
gauge frequently to see that it works accurately. It is furnished with
a lever for raising the valve, which should be raised occasionally to
see that it operates freely.</p>

<p class="space-above2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
The safety valve being set with steam gauge, the gauge should be
watched when safety valve blows off. If it indicates more or less than
the gauge something is wrong, the valve marked incorrectly or the
steam gauge is out of order. In case the safety valve and steam gauge
do not register alike, the valve should be examined to see that the
valve is not stuck in its seat, and should be thoroughly cleaned of
all sediment; then put back in place again and compared with the steam
gauge as before. If they do not register alike, the gauge should be
examined.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is not a safety valve attached to a boiler to prevent
explosion and loss of life?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The Safety Valve is only intended to prevent an explosion
from excessive steam pressure, and should never be set to hold more than
the required pressure to give the rated power for which the engine is
designed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">GLASS WATER GAUGE.</h3>

<p><b>A Glass Water Gauge</b> is a device attached to a boiler to show the
level of water in the boiler. It consists of a glass tube ten or twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
inches long, with an angle valve attached at each end. The lower valve
enters the boiler below the water line, the top valve enters the boiler
above the water line in the steam space. The ends of the glass are made
steam and water tight by means of rubber gaskets and stuffing boxes. As
water will seek its own level, the height of water in the boiler will
show a corresponding height in the glass, and the engineer at a glance
knows just how high the water in the boiler is above the flues and
crown sheet.</p>

accumulated by the use of impure water, and should be used more or less
frequently according to the condition of the water used, but never less
than once a week. There is also a surface blow off which is attached
to the boiler at about the safe water level for the purpose of blowing
off the scum which accumulates on top of the water. This scum should be
blown off once or twice a day.</p>

the boiler as low down as it is deemed safe to allow the water to
get, while the upper one enters the boiler sufficiently high to avoid
getting too much water. Where three gauges are used, the middle one
enters the boiler at about the proper water level. They should be
opened frequently to keep them free from corrosion, being sure to close
them tightly to prevent leaking.</p>

<p><b>A Check Valve</b> is the valve on the feed pipe between pump or

pressure of the feed water from the pump or injector lifts the valve
from its seat and the water passes into the boiler. Immediately after
the pressure from the pump or injector is released, the pressure from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
the boiler closes this valve and prevents the water from being forced
back into the pump or injector. There are two check valves used in
connection with a pump, one on suction, the other on deliver pipe.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How can check valves that get stuck open be closed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By simply tapping them slightly with a light hammer.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should this be practiced?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TRACTION ENGINES.</h2>
</div>

<p><b>Traction Farm Engines</b> are becoming more generally used each
year, and to supply the increasing demand for traction engines, the
manufacturers have spared no expense or mechanical skill to place upon
the market the latest improvements in this line, and a great many
kinds of this class of engine now made in the United States are simply
perfect. They travel over the roughest roads, up and down steep hills
with heavy loads, and the engine is at all times entirely under the
control of the engineer. In fact, there is no class of engines that has
had a more marked advancement toward perfection in the past few years
than the farm traction engine.</p>

<p>As this class of engines in the majority of cases goes into the hands
of men inexperienced in the handling of machinery, they are subjected
to the very hardest usage and neglect, which, of course, hastens their
destruction. Every purchaser of an engine should acquire sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
knowledge of the operating and handling of it so that he will know when
it is properly cared for.</p>

<p>No engine has to run at more variable speeds than a traction engine.
It is very important for this reason that the steam ports should be of
sufficient area to admit of a very high piston speed, and allow the
steam to follow the piston at the necessary velocity. Small ports are
useless, as when the link is notched up, and the travel of the valve
thereby reduced, the openings are too cramped for the steam to pass
in and out of the cylinder comfortably. The result is, that the slide
valve is forced off its seat and the engine primes as soon as any great
speed is attained. It is easy to tell by the sound of the exhaust if
the ports are rightly proportioned, and whether running at high or low
speed, the engine should give a clear and distinct exhaust at every
stroke of the piston.</p>

<h3 id="GEARING" class="nobreak">GEARING.</h3>

<p>The power of the traction engine is transmitted to the traction wheels
by a series of gearing, all of which should be made from accurately cut
patterns to insure the teeth meshing perfectly to prevent them from
cutting and grinding out, and of sufficient strength to withstand the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
very rough usage to which they are subjected. The gearing of an engine
should never be run without first greasing them thoroughly with a good
quality of solid oil or axle grease, for if once you allow the teeth to
cut, it will be impossible to stop them from cutting, the result being
they will soon be ruined. The gearing on traction engines are placed
in many different positions for transmitting the power to the traction
wheels, as will be seen by examining the different illustrations given
in this book.</p>

<p>On a side gear engine the power is transmitted from a small pinion
on the main shaft to an intermediate gear, from this gear to the
differential gear on cross shaft which is placed under the cylindrical
part of the boiler against the fire box. To this shaft are keyed two
small pinions at each end, which mesh in large spur gears fastened
securely to the traction wheels.</p>

<p>On a rear gear engine the power is transmitted from the small pinion
on crank shaft to large spur gear attached to one end of cross shaft,
which crosses the boiler at the rear end. To the other end of this
shaft is attached a small pinion that meshes in the large differential
gear which is attached to traction wheel and main axle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">DIFFERENTIAL GEAR.</h3>

<p>The gearing on a traction engine must be so designed as to allow one
of the ground or traction wheels to run faster than the other, when
turning engine either to right or left on the road. To accomplish
this, the Differential Gear is made use of, and answers all purposes
admirably.</p>

<p>The Differential Gear on many styles of engines is attached to the
cross shaft, while on others it is secured to the main axle, and, as
generally constructed, consists of one large spur gear, having three or
four bevel pinions placed in it at equal distances apart and from the
center of main gear. These pinions revolve loosely on pins secured to
the gear, and the spur gear runs loosely on the cross shaft or axle.
At each side of the spur gear are placed bevel gears, meshing into the
bevel pinions, one of which is keyed fast to the shaft or axle, while
the other is firmly bolted to small pinion that drives the traction wheel,
or to hub of the traction wheel, which also runs loosely on its axle.</p>

<p>This device allows one drive wheel to remain idle while the opposite
wheel may revolve as fast as is required to make the turn.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Differential Gears should be kept well greased with solid oil or axle
grease to prevent the cogs from being cut and wearing away rapidly.</p>

<h3 id="FRICTION_CLUTCH" class="nobreak">FRICTION CLUTCH.</h3>

<p>This attachment on a traction engine is almost indispensable as it
allows the engineer to give the whole power of the engine instantly to
the traction gear in getting the engine out of bad places, or to move
the engine backward or forward with so little apparent effort as to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
almost imperceptible, while the engine may be running at full speed;
also for tightening the main drive belt when attached to machinery
without stopping the engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="I_116" src="images/i_116.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="442" />
   <p class="f120 space-below2">J. I. Case Friction Clutch.</p>
</div>

<p>The friction clutch <a href="#I_116">shown in illustration</a> is constructed
as follows: The friction pulley is constructed with a friction ring upon its arms,
the outer ring acting as a guard or protection, the friction ring being
turned accurately to receive the wooden shoes attached to the driving
arm; these wooden friction shoes are fitted to the outer surface of the
ring as well as the inner, all being connected to one set of levers;
so when force is applied to engage the friction to start the engine
there is no tendency or danger of bursting the rim, as the pressure
is equal on both sides of it. The pulley is keyed to the crank shaft,
while the driving arm, with driving pinion secured firmly to it, runs
loosely upon the shaft. Upon the hub of driving arm is placed a sliding
sleeve with lever attached, which connects with toggle levers beneath
the sliding pieces which contain the wooden friction shoes, the whole
being operated by the sliding strap from footboard of engine near by the
reverse lever. This makes a strong and convenient arrangement for
transmitting power.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Many other styles of clutches are made by engine builders, adapted to
their particular style of engines, a common way being to have the shoes
tighten against the inner rim of the fly-wheel. This is not deemed as
good an arrangement, for the reason that the pressure or strain is all
outward against the rim, though their being used extensively indicates
good results.</p>

<p>When operating a friction clutch, always draw or push the lever over
gradually. By doing this the engine will start slowly and easily, while
if the lever is jammed over suddenly, the engine will start with a
jerk, which is liable to damage the traction gear. The latter should
never be done unless absolutely necessary to get the engine out of bad
places on the road.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What should be done first, after receiving a
new engine, to prepare it for running properly?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. If a traction or farm engine, remove the box
containing the fittings and tools, from the fire box, and see that the
grates are in their proper places. Also take out the tools which are
packed in the smoke box at front end of boiler. Then, with waste or
rags well saturated with kerosene, turpentine or benzine, wipe off all
the grease that the manufacturer has put on to protect the bright work
from rusting. After this has been thoroughly done, clean every oil hole
and bearing found upon the engine, of all dirt and cinders. Special
attention should be given to this, as if dirt and cinders are allowed
to remain, the bearings will cut and heat.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. After this is done thoroughly, what next?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Take all the fittings from the box and clean
them carefully, fit each oil cup to its proper place and screw them in
tightly with a wrench, to prevent them from working loose and falling
off while engine is running on the road.</p>

and cross-head. Then put the steam gauge, the glass water gauge, gauge
cocks, safety valve, whistle, surface blow-off and blow-off valves,
cylinder cocks, governor belt, etc., in their proper places; all
fittings should be screwed up tight with a wrench. Examine the stuffing
boxes and see that they are all well packed and cleaned.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. The fittings all being attached, what next?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;If a traction engine, examine all
the gearing and see that all gears, axles and bearings are thoroughly
greased and oiled—grease for gears and axles, oil for bearings.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;If firing with coal, keep the grates
well covered with a thin layer. Do not throw in large lumps or too much
fresh coal at one time. A thin fire lightly and frequently renewed, is
the most economical.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is the natural draught of the boiler enough to
enable steam to be raised quickly?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. The boiler and water being cold the fire
will not burn briskly, but as soon as steam pressure shows upon the
steam gauge, turn on the blower, which will force and increase the
draught; then with good fuel, any desired steam pressure can be raised
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Must the blower be used when the engine is
running to keep up sufficient steam pressure?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. When the engine is started, the exhaust
steam is discharged from the cylinder first through the heater, then
into smoke stack, producing the same effect as the blower.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. If the boiler steams too fast, what should be
done?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Simply close the damper. Do not open the
fire door, as the fire door should never be opened unless absolutely
necessary, nor should it be kept open longer than is needed, as the
cold air admitted through it injures the boiler and is wasteful of
fuel.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. After sufficient steam is raised, how do you
proceed to start the engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Before turning steam on the engine, go to the
fly-wheel and turn it a few times to see that everything is all right
and no obstacle in the way to prevent the engine from running when
steam is applied, being sure to leave the crank-pin off the center to
enable the steam to start the engine when throttle valve is opened.
Next, open both the cylinder cocks, then the throttle valve just a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
trifle to allow a little steam to enter the cylinder, to warm it and
expel the water of condensation. Then open the throttle gradually,
and if everything is right, the engine will move off faster and
faster until the proper speed is attained. After engine is thoroughly
heated and is working dry steam, close the cylinder cocks and set the
automatic oiler to work.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you obtain the proper speed, and how is
the engine made to run steadily with the steam pressure so varied?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The proper speed and steadiness in running is
maintained by the use of the governor, which receives its motion from
the engine shaft by means of a belt.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Are the bearings of a new engine liable to
heat when first started up?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Not if proper attention is given to them. When
starting a new engine the first time, it should be stopped frequently
and the moving parts and bearings carefully examined. Feel of all the
bearings, the link block, the eccentrics, crank-pin, cross-head, etc.,
to ascertain if they are heating. If they are, slacken up the boxes a
little, but not enough to make them knock or pound. Always be careful
not to loosen or tighten bearings or keys too much; just a trifle at a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
time, but do it often, until the bearings and boxes run cool, but
tight. If this is done carefully, the engine will run smoothly and
quietly.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. After the engine is started, what should be
done next?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Fill the tank on the engine with water and
start the injector to work, so that the proper level of water may
be kept in the boiler. The independent pump, if used, should now be
fitted, connected and tried, to see if it is in proper shape to feed
the boiler. If a cross-head pump is used, it should be fitted and
attached to water supply with the suction hose. In this case when the
engine is running, the pump can be regulated to supply the required
amount of feed water.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is the boiler supplied with water while
the engine is stopped?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By the independent pump or injector.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Has the independent pump sufficient capacity
to supply the boiler with water under all conditions?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, always, when running at a reasonable
speed.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why should an injector be furnished if the
pump will supply the boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Many times through carelessness or otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
the pump is prevented from working by dirt, straw, chips and other
obstructions which find their way into the pump and hold the valves
from their seats. In this case it is necessary to take the pump apart
and remove the obstructions wherever found, which would necessitate
stopping the engine and allowing the steam to go down, involving a
large loss of time. Whereas if the engine is also supplied with an
injector, should the pump fail, the injector can immediately be started
and the pump examined at leisure without loss of time and avoiding all
danger of explosion.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Should the supply of feed water be continuous
while the engine is running?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes. Gauge the speed of the independent pump
so that it will furnish the required amount of water to the boiler.
Regulate the feed of a cross-head pump, by the suction valve. By
so doing, the boiler steams easier, the flues are not so liable to
leak, and a uniform steam pressure can be easily maintained more
economically.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is a boiler supplied when engine is in
motion?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By the independent or cross-head pump.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When should the injector be used in preference
to the independent pump?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. There being no exhaust steam when engine is not running, no benefit
is derived from the heater. Now, as cold water should never be forced
into a hot boiler the injector becomes of great value, as it heats the
feed water to a very high temperature before it enters the boiler.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is there any independent steam pump made that
heats the feed water before it goes into the boiler?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. <a href="#I_093">See Marsh Pump description</a>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When engine, pump, and injector are found to
be working properly, what next?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. If a traction engine, the engine should be
reversed several times. This can be done by throwing the reverse lever
forward and backward, to ascertain whether the valve is so set that
engine will run equally well both ways; then the traction gear may be
tried. If engine is supplied with a <a href="#I_116">friction clutch</a>, by simply pressing
the clutch lever gradually until the friction shoes take hold, the
engine will start slowly upon the road. This can be done while engine
proper is running at full speed.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;The clutch lever should be held in
one hand when first starting, so that in case of anything being wrong
with gearing, it can be stopped immediately by quickly loosening the
lever. With the other hand, the steering wheel should be operated
to guide the engine upon the road. When all is found to be working
properly, and you wish to run the engine any distance, the clutch lever
should be placed in notch provided for it; this will hold the friction
shoes securely to the wheel, and the engine will move along the road at
full speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. If the engine has no friction clutch, how do
you proceed to start the gearing?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Stop the engine and place the reversing
lever in center notch, slide the spur pinion on main shaft into gear
and open the throttle valve wide; then with the reverse lever in one
hand (the steering wheel in the other) you can start engine upon the
road by throwing the lever backward or forward, which should be done
gradually at first, so that engine will start slowly. If all is right,
by throwing the reverse lever in the last notch in quadrant, the engine
will travel its full speed upon the road.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should a traction engine be first started
upon the road, forward or backward?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Always forward, as you can see where you are
going and can guide the engine more easily.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should you guide a traction engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. There is no fixed rule for guiding a traction

is required to make a success of it. One man should always handle both
reverse lever and steering wheel when guiding an engine.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should the steering chains be put on a

<h3 id="REVERSING" class="nobreak">REVERSING AN ENGINE.</h3>

<p>To reverse the motion of a plain Slide Valve engine, remove the cover
of steam chest and place the engine on the dead center. Observe the
amount of lead or opening that the valve has on the steam end, then
loosen the eccentric and turn it around on the shaft, in the direction
the engine is wanted to run, until the valve has exactly the same
amount of lead at the other end; then turn the engine to the opposite
center, to determine whether the lead at this end is the same as at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
other; then place the crank at half stroke top and bottom, and see that
the port openings are equal in both positions, and replace cover.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is dead center?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The dead center of an engine is the point
where crank and piston rod are in an exact line.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a half stroke?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It is the point reached by the piston after
traveling exactly one-half its travel.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the meaning of “lost motion”?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Lost motion is looseness of the connecting
rod at crank or wrist-pin, or looseness of the link or link block,
cross-head and guides, main crank shaft and pillow block, caused by
friction and wearing away of the metals and the neglect to take up the
wear.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;The lost motion in all parts of an
engine should be taken up frequently, to keep it running smoothly, but
care must be taken not to tighten bearings or keys too tight.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is lap and lead?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Lap is the position of the valve which extends
or laps over the edge of the ports when the valve is in its central
position. That on the inside of the D is the inside or exhaust lap,
while that at the ends of the valve is the outside lap and affects the
admission and cut-off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Lead is the amount of opening which is
given to the port by the valve when the engine is on the center.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Lead on a valve is the admission of
steam into the cylinder before the piston completes its stroke.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How much “lead” should a valve have?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. There is no general rule for the amount of
lead that would be best suited for all makes of engines. It must be
determined by the design or construction, speed and work required, to
produce the best results for economy and quietness in running.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a throttle engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A throttle engine is one in which the speed is
controlled by throttling the steam with a governor, as opposed to an
automatic engine in which the speed is regulated by varying the point
of cut-off at the valve.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the difference between a stroke and a
revolution?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A stroke is the movement of the piston, from
one end to the other of cylinder. A revolution takes two strokes of
piston.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How are steam packing rings put on the piston
head?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Remove the back cylinder head and take the
piston and rod out of the cylinder, and stand it “head up.” Then place
the inside of the ring, opposite to the opening, against the side of
the piston head next to you; gradually press the ring open with your
hands, and it can be easily slipped over the head and put in place.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is a piston put into cylinder?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It is always entered from the back end in
horizontal engines. The rings (if steam packing) should be carefully
placed in position and compressed by the hand if piston is small, but
if large, curved blocks of wood or a band of sheet iron can be used
to support them until they enter cylinder. When the piston rod passes
through the stuffing box, it should be supported at outer end to
prevent cutting.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>WATERTOWN HIGH SPEED ENGINE.</b></p>

<p>The frame of this engine is very heavy, with longitudinal and cross
ribs securely bracing it. It forms the lower guide for cross-head, and
contains the pillow block bearings at the front end. It also forms the
front cylinder head, to which the cylinder is bolted. The working parts
are placed as low in the frame as is possible, so that the strain is
brought in line with the line of greatest resistance.</p>

<p>The double disc center crank shaft allows of two small heavy band
wheels, one of which has the shaft governor attached to the inside,
that operates the valve automatically to give the point of cut-off in
accordance with the variation of load.</p>

<p>The valve is of a special design, and so constructed as to admit steam
to the cylinder port through four different openings. It also exhausts
steam through four different openings at once.</p>

<p>The engine frame rests its whole length and is securely bolted to the
sub-base, which is bolted to the floor, and the smaller sizes need no
elaborate foundations.</p>

<p>This style of engine ranges in size from 35 to 350 horse-power
approximately, the speed of the smaller ones ranging from 275 to 325

<h3 class="nobreak">TESTING PISTON RINGS AND VALVES.</h3>

<p>To ascertain whether the piston rings and valves are leaking or not,
first place a block of wood about four inches long upon the guide for
cross-head and against the front cylinder head. Then turn the engine
“over” until the cross-head comes back tight against the block. This
will place the valve of a simple engine in such a position that steam
would be admitted to cylinder through front steam port. If a reversing
engine, throw the reverse lever in the last notch in end of quadrant
that would allow the engine to run “over”. Then take off the back
cylinder head, and open the throttle valve wide. If steam blows out
past the piston, it would indicate that the rings were not tight. In
case steam packing rings are used, they should be refitted or replaced
by new ones. If adjustable rings are used, they should be adjusted to
stop the leak, care being taken not to get them too tight. If the steam
blows out through the back port, the slide valve is not tight and it
will require refitting, as will also the valve seat.</p>

<p>If a very small amount of steam blows through, new rings or adjustment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
would not be necessary, as the waste of steam or back pressure
resulting from it would amount to very little.</p>

<p>This test should be tried occasionally with a full head of steam on,
to assure of the piston rings and valve being tight, as leaky pistons
and valves are very wasteful of steam, sometimes causing priming, and
greatly diminishing the power of the engine. Never run your engine with
leaky piston or valve. Have them properly fitted at once.</p>

<p>After making the test, and repairing if necessary, replace the cylinder
head, and be sure to remove the wood block from the guides.</p>

<h3 id="KNOCKS" class="nobreak">KNOCKS OR POUNDS.</h3>

<p>The Knocks or Pounds of steam engines are frequently caused by
lost motion in the crank and wrist-pin boxes, valve rod and valve,
cross-head and link; looseness of the piston rod, pillow block or main
bearings, follower plate, or eccentrics; the slide valve having not
enough or too much lead, the exhaust being cut off too soon or too
late, shoulders being worn in each end of the cylinder by the packing
rings not traveling over the counter-bore at the end of each stroke; or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
shoulders may be worn in the guides by the cross-head slides, or they
may not be adjusted properly to fit the guides; boiler may foam,
causing the water to be drawn over in cylinder; the piston rings may
leak, thus causing cushioning; and as the crank approaches the centers,
steam occupies the space between the cylinder head and piston, causing
a tremendous strain upon the engine; the piston rod being packed too
tight, the boxes and pins being worn flat or oval; the key in driving
pulley may be loose.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">TO REMEDY KNOCKS OR POUNDS<br /> OF A STEAM ENGINE.</h3>

<p>While it is hardly possible to prescribe a remedy for all cases, if
the following practical methods are closely followed they will be
found to be very useful, although in many instances the remedy must be
determined by the circumstances of the individual case.</p>

<p>The knock or pound of boxes in connecting rod at cross-head or crank
pin or the valve rod, may be remedied by taking out the boxes, and
filing off the top and bottom inside edges sufficiently to allow them
to just come together and not fit the pin too tightly. In replacing
them, be careful not to key them up too tight.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>Where there is not sufficient draught in the key or gib, place a liner
in front or behind the boxes.</p>

<p>Knocks or pounds in the link may be remedied (if the link block has too
much play in the link) by reducing the liners in each end of the link
enough to fit the block properly.</p>

<p>The knocks or pounds of piston are caused by the rod becoming loose
in the head; and if allowed to continue, will destroy the fit of
the rod in the hole. It may be remedied under such circumstances by
removing the rod, re-boring the hole and bushing it perfectly true, and
refitting the rod.</p>

<p>Knocks or pounds of follower plate are generally caused by dirt
accumulating in the hole, which will not allow the bolts to enter far
enough to take up the lost motion of the plate, or the bolts may be too
long. To remedy this, remove the accumulation of dirt from the hole, or
shorten the bolts.</p>

<p>The knocks or pounds in main crank shaft, if caused by the bearings
being worn oval or out of round, may be remedied by removing the shaft;
true it up in a lathe, and refit or re-babbitt the boxes.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>The knock or pound in eccentrics is generally caused by the eccentric
straps being too loose upon the eccentrics, which can be remedied by
reducing the liners in the straps to allow them to fit perfectly.</p>

<p>The knock or pound in slide valve caused by being improperly set, may
be remedied by taking off the steam chest bonnet and re-adjusting the
valve so as to give the same amount of lead at each end of stroke.
This being done, and the valve well proportioned and the connections
properly fitted, there should be no knocks or pounds from this cause.</p>

<p>The knock or pound in cylinder caused by shoulders being worn in it,
can be remedied by re-boring the cylinder, being sure to make the
counter bore of sufficient depth to allow the piston rings to overlap
them at the end of each stroke.</p>

<p>The knock or pound on guides caused by shoulders being worn on them, is
remedied by planing the guides and making the shoe slides of sufficient
length to overlap the guides at either end when crank is on the center.</p>

<p>The knock or pound caused by the cross-head slides not fitting the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
guides properly, may be remedied by adjusting them both top and bottom
to fit the guides closely, being careful not to get them too tight,
which causes undue wear and strain upon the frame.</p>

<p>The knock or pound caused by wrist-pin or crank-pin becoming worn flat
or oval, may be remedied by filing them perfectly round.</p>

<p>The knock or pound caused by the piston leaking, which causes
cushioning, can be remedied only by having a tight piston.</p>

<p>The knock or pound caused by the driving pulley key being loose, can be
remedied by driving the key in its seat; or if a defective key, replace
by a new one perfectly fitted.</p>

<p>If the knocks or pounds are caused by lost motion in any of the
revolving, reciprocating or vibrating parts of an engine, they may be
detected and located by placing the finger upon the different parts
while the engine is running very slowly or worked back and forth by hand.</p>

<h3 id="HEATING" class="nobreak">HEATING OF JOURNALS.</h3>

<p>The heating of journals and reciprocating parts of an engine may be
attributed to the following causes:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Improper proportions and fitting, unsuitable material, want of
homogeneity between the metals of which the journals and bearings are
composed, the revolving or reciprocating parts not being in line,
the boxes being keyed up too tight, sand or grit getting into the
journals, improper lubricating, etc. The last mentioned cause is very
complicated, as the conditions of weight of load, area of surface
subject to pressure, velocity of movement, etc., must be taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>To remedy the heating of journals which is caused by the revolving or
reciprocating parts not being in line, the engine or shaft must be put
in line.</p>

<p>When caused by the boxes or bearings being too tight, they must be
loosened a very little at a time until bearings run cool. Apply plenty
of good oil.</p>

<p>Clean the boxes and journals thoroughly, and see that the oil holes are
not stopped up; also see that the oil-cups are clean, to assure of the
oil getting to the bearings freely.</p>

<p>Oiling frequently, using a little oil at a time, gives the best results
and is the most economical.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">PACKING PISTON AND VALVE RODS.</h3>

<p>When the piston or valve rod of an engine or pump needs re-packing,
take off the stuffing box gland, remove all the old packing carefully,
and replace with new.</p>

<p>If a patent packing is used, it should be cut in suitable lengths
diagonally across the packing, making the angle of one end opposite
from that of the other, so that when ends are brought together they
will make a splice joint. The joint of each ring of this packing should
be placed at opposite sides of the rod, and the stuffing box filled,
the gland replaced and screwed up just tight enough to stop leakage.
If hemp packing is used, take about the amount required and pick it to
pieces, removing all sticks, lumps or hard substances. Then twist it
into three compact cords, saturate well with oil or tallow, and braid
the cords together tightly. Then wind this braid around the rod until
stuffing box is full, replace the stuffing box gland, and screw up as
before described.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to screw the packing in stuffing boxes too
tight, as it not only increases the friction on the rod and diminishes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
the power of the engine, but will have a tendency to flute the rod. If
the rod is once fluted, it will be very difficult to stop leakage at
this joint.</p>

<p>When stuffing box of water piston of pumps needs re-packing, the same
rule will apply, with the exception that little or no grease or tallow
should be used upon the packing.</p>

<p>Always keep piston and valve rod packing in a clean place, as any dirt
or gritty substance that may become attached to it will have a tendency
to cut the rod.</p>

<h3 id="PLAIN_SLIDE" class="nobreak">SETTING A PLAIN SLIDE VALVE.</h3>

<p>First, take up all “lost motion” and place the engine on the center.
This is done by putting the wrist-pin, crank-pin and center of the
main shaft in line. To do this accurately, turn the engine until the
cross-head is about half an inch from the end of its stroke, and mark
the position of the cross-head on the guide.</p>

<p>Place a marker against the edge of the fly-wheel, and make a mark on
the fly-wheel opposite the marker, then turn the engine until the cross-head
completes the stroke and comes back to the mark made on the guide.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>The crank will now be as much below the center as it was above before.
In this position make another mark upon the fly-wheel opposite the marker.</p>

<p>Now, midway between the two marks on the fly-wheel, when turned
opposite the marker will put the engine on dead center. Next, remove
steam chest cover and place the eccentrics about one-quarter turn ahead
of the crank in the direction the engine is to run. If the engine is to
run “over”, place the throw of eccentric up. If it is to run “under”,
place throw of eccentric down.</p>

<p>Then set eccentric carefully at such a point that the valve will have
just commenced to open say ¹/₃₂ of an inch on the end that should
be taking steam. If there is a rocker arm used which reverses the
direction of the motion, i. e., making the valve stem move in the
opposite direction from the eccentric rod, the eccentric must be set
behind the crank, when the engine is to run “over”, in order that the
port may open as the engine turns forward; but if a rocker arm is used
merely to multiply the motion without changing the direction, proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
as though there was no rocker arm at all. Next, measure the “lead”
which you have given to the valve at end which you have set. This is
easily done by pushing a wedge-shaped stick or piece of soft wood
into the port opening. The edge of the valve and port will mark the
distance it goes in. Turn the engine upon the other center, which will
be found as before described, and see if the lead is the same at both
ends of the valve. If it is, the engine is properly set. If it is not,
move the valve on the stem towards the end having the greatest amount
of lead, a distance equal to one-half the difference in the leads. If
the equalized lead is more than is necessary, set the eccentric back a
little.</p>

<p>There are numerous methods of attaching the stem to the valve. A common
way is with jam-nuts. With this arrangement it is only necessary to
turn back the nuts on end towards which the valve is to be moved, an
amount which will allow the given movement; then, turn the other nuts
until the valve is forced into place to travel equal distance both ways
from its center position. When the stem screws directly into the valve,
the connection to the rocker arm or guide must be taken apart, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
stem screwed into or out of the valve enough to give it the required
position. After the valve is set, replace the steam chest cover, and
secure the eccentric perfectly tight with the set-screws, to prevent it
from slipping.</p>

<h3 id="REV_SLIDE" class="nobreak">SETTING SLIDE VALVE OF<br /> REVERSING ENGINES.</h3>

<p class="center space-below1"><b>The Link Reverse Being Used.</b></p>

<p>First, see that all the lost motion in the connecting rod, pillow
block bearings and cross-head is taken up; then throw the reverse
lever in last notch in quadrant, which would allow the engine to run
“over”; then, remove the steam chest cover. Next, loosen eccentric (the
eccentric rod of which is in direct line with the valve rod), turn the
eccentric completely around, and watch the valve to see whether it
laps the steam ports exactly the same amount at both ends, or travels
an equal distance from its central position both ways. If it does,
the valve is in proper position upon the rod. If it does not travel
equally, the valve must be made to do so by adjusting it upon the valve
rod, which is done by lengthening or shortening the rod, by use of
jam-nuts, with which the rod is usually furnished. After this is done
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
accurately, place the engine upon its forward center. This is done
by turning the engine forward until the cross-head is about ½ inch
from end of its stroke and mark the position of the cross-head upon
the guide; then, with the use of long tram or dividers, mark from any
convenient point on the frame to the band wheel or disc, and mark
both points with prick-punch. Again turn the engine forward until the
cross-head completes its stroke and comes back to the mark made on the
guide; then, with the same long tram or dividers, mark the band wheel
or disc as before from the prick mark already made on the frame.</p>

<p>Midway between punch marks on band wheel or disc, which can be found
by use of dividers, will give the point which will place the engine on
the “center” by turning engine back far enough to allow the long tram
or divider to fit in punch mark on frame, and center punch mark on band
wheel or disc. Now turn the eccentric over in the direction in which
the engine is to run, until the valve gives the proper amount of lead
on the front of steam port, which is about ¹/₃₂ of an inch, and fasten
eccentric with set-screw. Then turn engine over the way it is to run,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
and place it upon its back center. This is done exactly as before
described for forward center, and if the valve is properly
proportioned, it will give the required ¹/₃₂ of an inch lead on the
back steam port, and valve will be properly set for running in this
direction.</p>

<p>Now throw the reverse lever in the last notch in opposite end of
quadrant, which would allow the engine to run “under”, then loosen the
other eccentric (the eccentric rod of which is in a direct line with
the valve rod), and proceed same as described when engine is running
“over”, to get valve to lap both steam ports equally. Then place engine
upon either center and move the eccentric in opposite direction from
the other eccentric until the valve gives the ¹/₃₂ of an inch lead to
steam port, fasten the eccentric and place the engine upon opposite
center, and the amount of lead should be the same on both steam ports,
and the valve properly set.</p>

<p>The valve being set, replace the steam chest cover, and secure the
eccentrics perfectly tight by screwing the set-screws up hard to
prevent them from slipping.</p>

<p>Always set the valve so as to run the engine backwards or “under” first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">TO SET VALVES OF DUPLEX PUMP.</h3>

<p>Set the pistons at mid-stroke, and set the valves which are worked from
the opposite side at mid-stroke also, and it will be right at all other
points. The mid position of the valve can be obtained by moving it back
and forth the amount of its lost motion, and dividing it so that the
lead or opening on both sides will be the same.</p>

<h3 id="ASC_HILL" class="nobreak">ASCENDING HILLS.</h3>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you ascend a hill with a traction engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. When approaching a hill which you have to climb with
a traction engine, see that about two inches of water shows in the glass gauge
when engine is on a level. Open draft door wide, stir the fire and
get it to burn briskly, and get up a good head of steam. Put reverse
lever in last notch, then open throttle gradually, allowing just the
necessary amount of steam to pass into the cylinder to keep the engine
pulling steadily up the hill. Always start up the hill slowly; do not
attempt to go up a hill at full speed, but go slowly and steadily,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
keeping the speed as uniform as possible by opening or closing the
throttle as the case may be. Never attempt to go up a hill on a
decreasing steam pressure, as there is a great liability to become
stalled, in which case great damage may be done to the front end of
flues. Always start on a rising steam pressure; then you know the
boiler is making steam, which assures a steady ascent, as at every
exhaust of the engine on an increasing or steady pressure the power
becomes stronger, while at every exhaust on a decreasing pressure the
power becomes weaker. Keep a uniform supply of water in the boiler at
all times by use of either the pump or injector. Always when going up
hill keep the draft door wide open until the steam gauge indicates that
the pressure has risen almost to the blow-off point, then close the
damper. Never allow steam to blow off when going up hill, as it will
cause the water to raise and be carried over into the cylinder, greatly
diminishing the power of the engine. Do not under any circumstances
allow your engine to be stopped when going either up or down hill, as
great damage may be done to the boiler.</p>

traction engine.</p>

<p>This engine is constructed with an overhanging cylinder, bolted to the
cast iron engine frame, which contains the locomotive style guides and
both pillow block bearings for the crank shaft. It has a Cross-head
Pump connected with long heater, has a specially designed Reverse Gear,
also a <a href="#I_116">Friction Clutch</a> attached to the band wheel.</p>

<p>The round bottom fire box boiler swings in a channel iron frame, which
reaches from front axle to the rear of the boiler, around the fire box,
to which it is attached, and has a spring in front end only.</p>

<p>The wheels are made entirely of iron, with forged spokes and wrought
tire, with high mud grouters bolted on.</p>

<p>On the channel iron frame in front of fire box is placed a heavy
plank, to which two large water tanks are attached on either side. The
steering wheel and band wheel are on opposite sides of engine and it
has all the necessary fittings, so that with proper handling it will
be found perfectly safe and reliable. The platform in rear is also

<h3 class="nobreak">DESCENDING HILLS.</h3>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you descend a hill with a traction engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. When approaching a hill which you wish to
descend with a traction engine, see that the water in the boiler is at
the regular height, or two inches in glass gauge when engine is on the
level. Close the draught door to ash pan and open damper in smoke box
when about to descend. Close the throttle almost tight, allowing just a
little steam to enter cylinder, then take hold of the reversing lever,
and the speed of the engine can be governed so as to descend at any
speed desired, or be stopped, if absolutely necessary by throwing the
lever into last notch.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Do not stop while going down hill
unless absolutely necessary, as there is great danger of melting out
the fusible plug and damaging the crown sheet, as the water is much
lower over the crown sheet when going down hill with the required
amount of water in the boiler than at any other time.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;When it is absolutely necessary to
stop the engine for a short time when descending a hill, do not turn on
the pump or injector; but open the fire door, allowing the cold air
to pass over the fire, which will protect the crown sheet. This should
never be done, though, except in extreme cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">ENGINE STALLED.</h3>

<p>There is no standard rule by which a traction engine can be gotten
out of bad places upon the road, as one rule would not apply to all
situations, though a few suggestions on this subject may be beneficial.</p>

<p>When the engine is in a bad mud hole, or on a very sandy road, and the
driving wheels will not take hold, but simply turn around, the best
way to get out of the fix is to hitch a good team of horses to it and
pull it out with what assistance the engine can give. Though in many
cases, if a quantity of straw, stones or brush, as may be most handy,
is placed under the driving wheels and the power applied, the wheels
may get a footing and the engine will come out all right. Old boards or
rails placed in the same manner will produce the same result.</p>

<p>It should be understood, however, that if the driving wheels do not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
take hold, but simply turn around in the sand or mud, the engine should
be stopped at once and some of the aforesaid remedies tried. If you
continue to work the engine under such circumstances, it will become
more difficult to get out of the mire, as the wheels sink deeper in at
every revolution.</p>

<h3 id="CROSS_BRIDGE" class="nobreak">CROSSING BRIDGES AND CULVERTS.</h3>

<p>Before crossing a bridge or culvert with a traction engine, examine the
stringers and floor carefully to ascertain whether it is in condition
to hold the engine or not. If it appears a little weak, by laying heavy
plank across for the traction wheels to run on, it may be crossed in
safety, though the crossing of small bridges and culverts must be done
with judgment, to prevent accident and delay.</p>

<h3 id="FOAMING" class="nobreak">FOAMING.</h3>

<p>Foaming is the violent agitation of the volume of water in the boiler;
it occurs only in dirty boilers and where dirty feed water is used,
which causes the water to become saturated with foreign matter, such as
lime, sediment, mud, oil or grease, etc.</p>

<p>The steam trying to escape through the scum formed by these impurities,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
raises the whole mass from the surface of the water in large bubbles,
and causes a general frothing or foaming condition of the water level,
which is indicated by the dirty appearance of the gauge cocks and
joints and the cutting of piston rod and cylinder by the gritty matter
carried over by the steam. Foaming does not result in carrying over so
much water, but a foamy boiler does not produce as dry steam as one
that is kept perfectly clean.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you prevent a boiler from foaming?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. To remedy foaming, or prevent it, requires
frequent blowing off from the surface of the water the scum which
causes it, and the use of pure feed water. It may be stopped for a
while by closing the throttle valve for an instant, to give the water
and scum a chance to settle.</p>

<h3 id="PRIMING" class="nobreak">PRIMING.</h3>

<p>Priming in a steam boiler is the carrying over of large quantities of
water by the steam to the engine, and may occur in a perfectly clean
boiler. It is usually caused by too great a demand on the capacity of
the boiler, too sudden and fierce firing, or after steam pressure is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
lowering, an increasing demand is made for it. It is usually a radical
defect in the construction or capacity of the boiler, and is most
frequently the result of insufficient steam space, small evaporating
capacity, and lack of good circulation.</p>

<p>Priming is indicated by the water rising and lowering in the glass
gauge more or less violently, by the clicking sound in the steam
cylinder of engine as the piston forces the water from end to end, and
by the regular shower of water falling from the exhaust.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you remedy priming?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. There are several remedies for priming, none of which will apply
effectually in all cases. Where insufficient capacity is the cause,
the only remedy is a larger boiler. In others, it may be prevented
by carrying the water level lower, if same can be done with safety,
or taking steam from side of dome instead of top, or increasing the
size of steam pipe, or taking out the top row of flues, and in boilers
that have no steam dome, a long dry pipe with perforated top may be of
benefit.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What are other causes and remedies for priming?</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The piston rings may leak badly. If they do, they should be
replaced, or made to fit cylinder perfectly. The cylinder may be badly
cut by the rings. If it is, it should be re-bored and new piston rings
put in.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;The slide valve may be cut, and
leak. In this case the valve will need re-planing and scraping, also
the valve seat. If the valve is not properly set, it may also cause
priming. The exhaust nozzle may be clogged with burnt oil and sediment;
if it is, clean it out thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="WOOD" class="nobreak">FIRING WITH WOOD.</h3>

<p>Always keep a level fire. Fill every open space as fast as the wood
burns out. Allow as little cold air to pass through the fire as
possible. <i>Never stir a wood fire.</i> Fire quickly, and keep the
door shut as much as possible.</p>

<h3 id="STRAW" class="nobreak">FIRING WITH STRAW.</h3>

<p>To start the fire, push a small forkful of dry straw into funnel in
fire door, leaving the small end of funnel pressed full; then touch
the match to it. Begin at once to push in the straw regularly, a small
quantity at a time, being very careful not to clog the main flue, and
allowing ample time for straw to burn.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>The fire should be raked down frequently, as the burned straw leaves a
charred mass over the grates. This should be done when the funnel is
full of straw, thus allowing no cold air to pass through the funnel
into the main flue. Clean out the ash pan frequently, so that the
natural draught may not be checked. Do not open blower until gauge
shows ten or fifteen pounds steam pressure.</p>

<p>After steam is raised to the necessary pressure, the feeding should be
regular, using small forkfuls of straw, keeping the funnel full all the
time, and raking down at short intervals. Use as dry straw as it is
possible to obtain.</p>

<p>The above will apply to any style or make of straw-burning engines.</p>

<h3 id="COAL" class="nobreak">FIRING WITH COAL.</h3>

<p>After fire is well started with wood, throw coal into the center of
grate, and do not disturb it until it is well ignited and burning
briskly; then break the fire down and put in a shovel or two of coal,
and so continue keeping the grates covered with a thin layer.</p>

<p>Always aim to put in fresh coal on a rising head of steam pressure.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
Never pile coal against the flue sheet or keep the fire box too full.
Nothing is gained by the latter, but much is lost.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Which is the more economical to burn, wet or dry coal?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Dry. If your coal is wet, you simply have to evaporate that much
more water, which goes out of the stack instead of to the engine.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How much water will one pound of coal evaporate?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. One pound of coal will, under very favorable circumstances,
evaporate twelve pounds of water, but the average evaporative power
of anthracite coal is 9½ pounds of water, and semi-bituminous coal is
9⁹/₁₀ pounds.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. If cold air is allowed to strike the flue sheet and flues, what is
the result?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It will eventually cause them to leak.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should a fire be regulated in case of temporary stoppage by
accident or otherwise under full head of steam?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Close the damper and keep the fire door closed; then open small door
in smoke box or the damper in chimney.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why not leave the fire door open?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Because it would allow the cold air to come in contact with flue
sheet and flues, and consequent damage to boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">BANKING FIRES.</h3>

<p>To bank a fire in a furnace, push the fire in a heap at the back of the
furnace against the flue sheet; leaving a large portion of the grate
open, to allow the air caused by the natural draught to pass up over
the fire to the flues; then cover it over with fine coal or a layer of
dry ashes, and see that the draught door is closed to prevent draught
as much as possible.</p>

<p>This being done, the fire will last over night, and when ready to start
again in the morning, all that is necessary to do is to rake the fire
over the grates, open the damper and apply more fuel.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What benefit is derived from banking the fire?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By banking the fire, the water in the boiler is kept warm over night
and steam is raised quickly in the morning, saving time and fuel.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When leaving a banked fire, is it practicable to shut the water out
of the glass or water column?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes. In freezing weather, this may be done by closing the valve at
the top and bottom of the glass; and open pet cock beneath. Care should
be taken, however, to open them before the fire is started in the
morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">LAYING UP A TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How should you prepare your engine and boiler
for laying up through the winter, to protect them from frost and
injury?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. While steam is on, clean your boiler and
engine thoroughly outside, scrape off all oil, grease and scale; after
which apply a good coat of asphaltum paint to the boiler and smoke
stack. If no paint can be had, lamp black and linseed oil will answer.
If this cannot be had, take rags, saturate them with grease or oil, and
go over them with that.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Now open the blow-off valve, and
blow the water off with a low pressure of steam, after which take out
all the hand-hole plates and wash the boiler out thoroughly, removing
all the mud and scale; then replace the hand-hole plates, close the
blow-off valve and fill the boiler nearly full of water, after which
pour in a gallon of black oil upon the water.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;After this is done, open the blow-off
valve again and allow the water to run out. The oil will follow the
water down and cover the whole inside of boiler with a coating of oil,
making as good a protection against rust as can be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Next, remove all the brass fittings,
such as lubricator, steam gauge, safety valve, injector, check valves,
pump valves, gauge cocks, water gauge, etc., etc.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Disconnect all pipes where water may
lodge, in order to prevent freezing. Every pipe and valve allowed to
freeze will surely burst. Unscrew all stuffing boxes and remove the
packing; for unless this is done, another season you will find parts
badly rusted where the packing was allowed to remain.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Take off all cylinder cocks, pet
cocks, etc., from the heater and pump. All fittings should be carefully
packed and laid away. Clean the flues and fire box, also the ash pan,
and do not neglect to paint the ash pan both inside and outside.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;Remove the back cylinder head, roll
the engine forward and smear the inside of cylinder with tallow, or oil
if no tallow can be had. Place the head back again and smear all the
bright work, such as piston rod, connecting rod, etc., with grease. Do
not forget to cover top of smoke stack, to keep out water and snow.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;If the foregoing directions are
followed carefully you will find another season that your engine will
be clean, free from rust and ready to serve you faithfully without any
trouble or delay in starting, either in time or expense.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">BELTING.</h3>

<p>Do not tax belts by overloading. Keep them free from accumulation of
dust, grease and all animal oils, as these are injurious to both rubber
and leather belts.</p>

<p>Special care should be taken to protect the edges of rubber belts from
all animal oils, as they are liable to rot the belt.</p>

<p>Always run the grain (or hair) side of leather belts on the pulley, as
it gives greater driving power, hugs the pulley closer, is less liable
to slip, and will drive 30 per cent. more than the flesh side.</p>

<p>Rubber belts will be greatly improved and their life prolonged, by
putting on with a brush, and letting it dry, the following mixture:</p>

<p>Equal parts of black lead and litharge mixed with boiled oil; add
enough Japan to dry it quickly. In case the rubber peels off, the same
mixture can be used.</p>

<p>In comparison to leather belts, 4-ply rubber is equivalent to a single
leather belt and 6-ply rubber to double leather belt.</p>

<p><b>To find the length of a belt</b>, add the diameter of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
pulleys together, divide the result by 2 and multiply the quotient by
3¹/₇; then add to this product twice the distance between the centers
of shafts.</p>

<p><b>When piecing a belt when pulleys are changed</b>, multiply the
difference of the diameters of the pulleys by 1½, the product will be
the length of the piece required.</p>

<p>The seam side of rubber belt should always be placed outside and not
next to pulley. In case the belt slips, coat the side next to pulley
with boiled linseed oil or soap.</p>

<p><b>In lacing a belt</b>, begin in the center and be careful to keep
both ends exactly in line. Lace both ends equally tight and do not
cross the lace on the pulley side of belt. Great care should be taken
that the ends butting together be cut perfectly square; if not, the
belt will stretch more on one side than the other, which greatly
impairs its worth.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the practical limit of belt speed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Belts should not be run much over 5000 feet per minute.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How then is the capacity of a belt affected by its speed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It varies directly as the speed. A given belt will transmit twice
the horse-power if its speed is doubled within limits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is the capacity of a belt affected by its
width?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, the capacity varies directly as the
width. If a two inch belt will transmit one horse-power, two such belts
will transmit two horse power; and this is true whether they are run
separately or joined into a four inch belt.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">&nbsp;&emsp;To preserve cotton or Gandy belting,
apply with a brush a little common paint to pulley side of belt while

<p>The cylinder and steam chest of this engine are cast in one piece and
bolted securely to the engine frame, which forms the front cylinder
head. The cylinder is lagged with mineral wool and jacketed to prevent
radiation, and it is overhanging and self-lining.</p>

<p>The valve is a hollow piston valve, the body of which is steel
tubing with cast iron ends. It receives its motion from the shaft
governor, attached to one of the band wheels, which regulates the
cut-off automatically according to the variation of load. The steam
is exhausted at each end of the valve by very direct passages which
quickly free the cylinder, preventing back pressure.</p>

<p>The engine frame is cast heavy and rigid, and contains the locomotive
guides for cross-head and the pillow block bearings for the crank shaft.</p>

<p>The double disc center crank shafts allow of two small heavy band
wheels being used.</p>

<p>The base of this engine is cast in one piece, to which the engine frame
is securely bolted, and with this arrangement, the engine needs no
expensive foundation.</p>

<p>The engine is simple and self-contained, ranging in sizes from 11 to
450 horse-power, and is intended to run at the very high speed of
from two hundred to three hundred and fifty revolutions per minute
according to size, and is used extensively in driving electric lighting
machinery, and where high speed and continuous work is desired.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">GENERAL INFORMATION.</h2>
</div>

<p><i>Never condemn an engine</i> that is entirely new to you because
it does not start off at your first effort. Study all the directions
furnished by the maker. Perhaps you have overlooked some points that
are of more importance than you imagine.</p>

<p>The above will apply to other machinery as well as engines.</p>

<p><i>When starting a new engine</i> be sure that everything is in
readiness. Turn it over by hand to see that all the revolving and
reciprocating parts run freely. Start it very slowly under steam
pressure and apply plenty of good oil. After it has run a short time
and everything is working properly turn on more steam and continue to
do so until the engine is running at its rated speed. To start it at
full speed under steam pressure may result in great damage or totally
destroy the engine.</p>

<p><i>An accurate machine</i> which is thoroughly reliable is necessarily
costly, but is of more value than another which merely serves a purpose.</p>

<p><i>Engineers or firemen</i> in charge of a steam boiler should blow out
the water gauge and gauge cocks every morning in order to remove the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
soft mud which settles in them at night when the boiler is at rest. If
this is neglected, the soft mud may become baked in them which might
lead to disastrous results.</p>

<p><i>Every steam boiler</i> for whatever purpose employed, should be
opened, cleaned, thoroughly examined and tested at least every six
months, and with muddy feed water once a week would not be too often.</p>

<p><i>By blowing out</i> the gauge cocks regularly you not only ascertain
the height of the water in the boiler, but it prevents them from
becoming choked with sediment or mud.</p>

<p><i>Do not allow</i> the gauge cocks, glass water gauge or steam gauge
to become filthy, as it shows lack of care, and furnishes evidence that
the engineer who is not particular in this part of his duty is not
reliable in others of equal or more importance.</p>

<p><i>Upon entering</i> the boiler room in the morning an engineer or
fireman should always ascertain whether the valves or cocks which
connect the water gauge with the boiler are open or shut, otherwise
he may be deceived by the appearance of the water in the tube. This
precaution should never be neglected.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p><i>If an engineer or fireman discovers</i> that there is too much water
in the boiler he should blow it down to the proper level, but in doing
so he must exercise judgment, vigilance and care, especially if there
is a fire in the furnace.</p>

<p><i>Never allow the gauge cocks</i> to leak at all when it is
practicable to repair them, for the longer they leak the more difficult
they are to repair, as under the escape of water or steam the metal
wastes rapidly.</p>

<p><i>An engineer or fireman</i> should often remove the ashes from under
the boiler, or from ash pan; if allowed to accumulate, they retard the
draft and interfere with combustion, thereby causing waste of fuel and
interfere with the evaporating efficiency of the boiler. Also keep
grates clear of clinkers; for if allowed to accumulate, they produce
the same result.</p>

<p><i>Should it become necessary</i> to blow down the water at intervals,
the engineer or fireman should stand by the blow-off cock and not allow
his attention to be diverted to anything else, as in a very short space
of time the water may become so low as to induce stoppage or endanger
the safety of the boiler.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p><i>Engineers should</i> always be cautious when they stop or start an
engine with a heavy pressure of steam in the boiler, as the vent given
to the steam when starting, and the check it receives when stopping,
may exert such a pressure as to strain, crack, or rupture the boiler.</p>

<p><i>The drip cocks</i> in the cylinder should be left open when the
engine is standing still, and they should not be closed until after the
engine has been started and made several strokes or revolutions.</p>

<p><i>Do not open the throttle valve</i> to its full extent in starting
after the engine has been standing over night, as the quantity of steam
condensed by being brought in contact with the cold pipe (particularly
if it is a long one) may result in breaking the follower plate,
springing the piston rod, or knocking out the cylinder head.</p>

<p><i>After opening the gauge cocks</i> to ascertain the height of water
in the boiler, they should be closed tightly to prevent leakage.</p>

<p><i>It may have been discovered</i> that when gauge cocks are closed
after being blown out, they leak badly; this is often due to the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
that mud or sand has become attached to the seat of the valve. The
easiest way to remedy this difficulty is to open the cocks and let them
blow out for some time, as the friction of the water in its escape will
in all probability remove the obstacle.</p>

<p><i>Glass water gauges</i> may be cleansed by removing the glass; then
tying a piece of cotton waste or lamp wicking to a splint of wood,
applying soap or acetic acid, and passing it through the inside of the
tube; then replace the glass, and when steam is raised close the lower
valve, open the drip cock, and the steam blowing through will wash the
glass perfectly.</p>

<p><i>To cut a glass gauge tube.</i>—If a glass gauge is too long, take
a three-cornered file and wet it, hold the tube in the left hand with
the thumb and fore-finger at the place where you wish to cut, saw it
quickly and lightly two or three times with the edge of the file, and
it will mark the glass. Now, take the tube in both hands, both thumbs
being on opposite sides of the mark and about an inch apart, then try
to bend the glass, using your thumbs as fulcrums and it will break at
the mark which has weakened the tube.</p>

<p><i>Never touch</i> the inside of the water gauge glass with iron or
wire, as while the glass may be cut on the outside with a file, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
slightest touch of steel or iron on the inside will cause an abrasion,
the result of which is that the glass will crack and become useless.</p>

<p><i>Water gauge glasses</i> frequently break because the steam and water
connections are not in line, because the stuffing boxes are screwed
down too tight, and sometimes in cold weather when struck by a cold
draught of air admitted through an open door or window.</p>

<p><i>An engineer or fireman should</i> never fill a boiler with cold
water while the boiler is hot, as the injurious effect produced by
contraction is similar to that produced by blowing out at a high
pressure, and if persisted in will result in permanent injury to the
boiler.</p>

<p><i>Exhaust steam will heat</i> water to 212° Fahr. under atmospheric
pressure.</p>

<p><i>Ten degrees extra heat</i> in feed water means one per cent. saving
in fuel.</p>

<p><i>Before blowing out the boiler</i> the engineer or fireman should
remove all the fire from the furnace, as a small quantity left in the
corners, or attached to the bridge wall, might spring a seam or cause a
plate to bulge.</p>

<p><i>Every engineer should know</i> that unequal expansion and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
contraction is one of the evils which limit the longevity and endanger
the safety of all classes of steam boilers; consequently the blowing
out, the refilling, the starting of fires and the regulation of the
draught should be done with judgment.</p>

<p><i>It is not necessary</i> to fill a boiler with cold water above
the second gauge cock, as the water expands under the process of the
formation of steam and it will be found that there is a sufficiency of
water in the boiler when steam is raised.</p>

<p><i>Single riveted seams</i> are equal to 56% of the original strength
of the sheet; double riveted seams are equal to 70%, and triple riveted
seams are equal to 85%. Triple riveted seams, however, are very seldom
used unless for some special purpose, as they are too heavy and thick,
and would burn out rapidly if exposed to fire.</p>

<p><i>In making calculations</i> on the strength of boilers, the factor 56
should be employed instead of 100, as 44% of the strength of the plate
is lost by punching the holes for the rivets.</p>

<p><i>It should be understood</i> that machine riveted seams in steam
boilers are superior to hand made seams, as the machine thoroughly
upsets the rivet and brings the two sheets in such close contact as to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
produce friction between the sheets at the lap, which of itself is an
element of strength.</p>

<p><i>Boilers do not improve</i> by standing idle; they will rust very
rapidly.</p>

<p><i>Never use sharp chisels</i> to cut the scale from boiler plate, as
the cutting of the plate does more harm than good. Use only a light
hammer.</p>

<p><i>In patching a boiler</i> be careful not to make a pocket in which
sediment may collect to cause another injury to the sheet and never put
a steel patch upon an iron boiler as the two metals expanding unequally
will induce trouble.</p>

<p><i>Never forget</i> to allow for expansion when running long lines
of steam pipe, whether for heating or power, as the neglect of this
precaution leads to the formation of immense crooks or bends in the
line of pipe wonderful to behold. There must be a slip joint somewhere
in long lines of steam piping, unless expansion is allowed for.</p>

<p><i>Valves stick</i> on their seats because they are frequently shut
when cold, and when heated by the steam the valve stem becomes
lengthened, and presses the valve hard into the seat.

<p class="space-above2"><i>Slide valves should be fitted</i> to their
seats by filing and scraping, and never by the use of emery and oil.
The piston rod and valve rod may be packed with braids of hemp or
cotton wicking, with rings cut from patent packing of various kinds or
metallic packing.</p>

<p><i>To clean brass articles</i> with acid is a great mistake, as with
such treatment they very soon become dull. Sweet oil and putty powder
followed by soap and water, is one of the best mediums for brightening
brass and copper.</p>

<p><i>To frost brass work</i> and give it an ornamental finish, boil the
article in caustic potash, rinse in clean water and dip in nitric acid
until all oxide is removed; then wash quickly, dry in box-wood sawdust,
and lacquer while warm.</p>

<p><i>The best material</i> for grinding in valves and stop cocks is
pulverized glass. It is superior to emery for this purpose. Fine sand
may be used.</p>

<p><i>To remedy a leaky</i> angle, check or globe valve, it should be
taken apart, and the valves ground to fit their seats properly with
either fine sand, pulverized glass or emery.</p>

<p><i>A lever stuck</i> between the spokes of the fly-wheel of an engine
for the purpose of starting it, is a very dangerous instrument, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
liable to get caught and do a great amount of damage. If a lever is to
be used, be sure that the steam is first turned off.</p>

<p><i>A cubic inch of water</i> evaporated under ordinary atmospheric
pressure is converted into one cubic foot of steam (approximately).</p>

<p><i>Steam at atmospheric pressure</i> flows into a vacuum at the rate of
about 1550 feet per second, and into the atmosphere at the rate of 650
feet per second.</p>

<p><i>Condensing engines require</i> from 20 to 30 gallons of water
to condense the steam represented by every gallon of water
evaporated—approximately; for most engines we say from 1 to 1½ gallons
per minute per indicated horse-power. Jet condensers do not require
quite as much water for condensing as surface condensers. Surface
condensers require about 2 square feet of tube (cooling) surface per
horse-power of steam engine.</p>

<p><i>The best designed boilers</i> well set, with good draught and
skillful firing, will evaporate from 7 to 10 lbs. of water per pound of
first-class coal. The average result is from 25 to 60 per cent. below this.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p><i>When you have</i> your boiler furnace to repair, and cannot get fire
clay, take common earth mixed with water, in which you have dissolved a
little salt; use same as fire clay, and your furnace will last fully as long.</p>

<p><i>To make iron take bright polish</i> like steel, pulverize and
dissolve the following articles in one quart of hot water: Blue vitriol
1 oz., borax 1 oz., prussiate of potash 1 oz., charcoal 1 oz., salt 7½
pt.; then add one gallon of linseed oil, mix well, bring your iron or
steel to the proper heat, and cool in the solution.</p>

<p><i>To write inscriptions on metal</i>, take 4 oz. of nitric acid
and 1 oz. of muriatic acid, mix and shake well together, then cover
your metal surface to be engraved, with bees-wax or soap, write your
inscription plainly in the wax clear to the metal, then apply the mixed
acids, carefully filling each letter. Let it remain from three to five
minutes according to appearance desired, then throw on water, which
stops the etching process, scrape off the bees-wax or soap, and the
inscription is complete.</p>

<p><i>To remove rust from steel.</i>—Brush the rusted steel with a paste
composed of ½ oz. cyanide potassium, ½ oz. castile soap, 1 oz. whiting,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
and enough water to make a paste; then wash the steel in a solution of
½ oz. cyanide potassium and 2 oz. of water.</p>

<p><i>A solvent for rust.</i>—It is often very difficult, and sometimes
impossible, to remove rust from articles made of iron. Those which are
most thickly coated are most easily cleaned by being immersed in, or
saturated with, a solution of chloride of tin. The length of time they
should remain in this bath is determined by the thickness of the rust,
generally twelve to twenty-four hours is long enough. The solution
ought not to contain a great excess of acid if the iron itself be
not attacked. On taking them from the bath, the articles are rinsed
first in water, then in ammonia, and quickly dried. The iron when thus
treated has the appearance of dull silver; a simple polishing gives it
its normal appearance.</p>

<p><i>One of the best varnishes</i> for smoke stacks or steam pipes is
good asphaltum dissolved in oil of turpentine.</p>

<p><i>Iron or steel immersed</i> warm in a solution of carbonate of soda
(washing soda) for a few minutes will not rust.</p>

<p><i>Cement to fasten iron to stone.</i>—Take 10 parts of fine iron
filings, 30 parts of plaster of Paris, and ½ part of sal ammoniac; mix
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
with weak vinegar to a fluid paste and apply at once.</p>

<p><i>Cement for joints.</i>—Paris white, ground, 4 lbs.; litharge,
ground, 10 lbs.; yellow ochre, fine, ½ lb.; ½ oz. of hemp, cut short;
mix well together with linseed oil to a stiff putty. This cement is
good for joints on steam or water pipes; it will set under water.</p>

<p><i>The average consumption of coal</i> for steam boilers is 12 pounds
per hour for each square foot of grate surface.</p>

<p><i>One ton of coal</i> is equivalent to two cords of wood for steam
purposes.</p>

<p><i>Doubling the diameter</i> of a pipe increases its capacity four
times.</p>

<p><i>A cubic foot</i> of water contains 7½ gallons.</p>

<p><i>A gallon weighs</i> 8⅓ pounds.</p>

<p><i>Water expands</i> ¹/₉ of its bulk in freezing.</p>

<p><i>Ice weighs</i> 56½ pounds per cubic foot.</p>

<p><i>Engineers can judge</i> of the condition of their machinery by the
tone it gives out while running. Every make of engine has a peculiar
tone of its own. The engineer becomes accustomed to that, and any
departure from it at once excites a suspicion that all is not right.
The engineer may not know what is the matter, he may have no ear for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
music, but the change in tone of his machine will be instantly
perceptible and will start him upon an immediate investigation.</p>

<p><i>An Indicator</i> is an instrument used to determine the indicated
horse-power of an engine; it shows the action of the steam in the
cylinder and serves as a guide in setting valves to get the greatest
amount of energy from the steam used.</p>

<p><i>Atmospheric pressure</i> is the weight of the air.</p>

<p><i>To take lime from injector tubes</i>, mix one part muriatic acid and
ten parts soft water. Immerse tube in this mixture over night.</p>

<p><i>Compound for Cooling Heavy Bearings.</i>—For cooling heavy pillow
block bearings, or the steps of upright shafts, the following will be
found very valuable: Four pounds of tallow, one-half pound of sugar
of lead, three-fourths pound plumbago. When the tallow is melted
(not boiling) add sugar of lead and let it dissolve; then put in the
plumbago, and stir the whole mass until cold.</p>

<p><i>A mixture</i> of soft soap and black lead makes an excellent
lubricant for gears, as it lessens the abrasion and noise and has the
advantage over tallow of not becoming hard. It is also easily removed
should it become necessary to clean the parts on which it has been used.</p>

<p><i>The axles and axle arms</i> of a traction engine should be well
greased or oiled before moving, to prevent them from being cut and
wearing both hub and axle rapidly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">COMPOUND ENGINES.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Compound Engine dates from the year 1781, when Hornblower, a
contemporary of Watt, conceived the idea of utilizing the force in the
exhaust steam of the simple engine in a second cylinder.</p>

<p>From his crude design, the constant progress of experiment has
developed the marvelous engines now used in ocean steamers, and in both
large and small power plants, also on locomotives. Some of the compound
engines built in the early part of the century show results, according
to the records, not far behind the best attainable in modern times.</p>

<p>The era of the Compound locomotive engine began in Europe in 1876, but
in this country half a dozen years would almost cover its history.</p>

<p>However, in this short time, its advantages in putting to profitable
use the entire force of the steam supplied, has been so clearly shown,
that it has evidently come to stay. Its availability as an efficient,
economical, powerful high speed locomotive, demonstrates the value of
the Compound as a farm traction engine, and makes it plain that it will
be extremely serviceable on this class of engines.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>The Compound Traction Engines belonging to the class known as the
“Woolf,” or continuous expansion type, are so constructed that the
steam passes directly from the high pressure to the low pressure
cylinder without the intervention of any receiving chamber or steam
chest. This arrangement is considered much better adapted to traction
engine work, and to produce superior results under the varying
conditions of this class of work than the “cross” compound, or what
is generally styled the “receiver” type of compound engines, in which
the high pressure cylinder exhausts into a receiver connected with the
steam chest of the low pressure cylinder.</p>

<p>In the Woolf Compound as constructed, the cylinders are either cast
in one piece, end to end, or cast separately and bolted together in
substantially the same way, in order that perfect alignment can be
secured by boring both cylinders at the same operation. This makes it
not only easy to get them in line at the start, but it prevents any
possibility of their getting out of line, which is a very important
feature.</p>

<p>The pistons of both cylinders are upon the one rod, thus requiring only
one cross-head, connecting rod and crank. There is but one steam chest,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
in which a valve is placed, with such relation to the valve seat
which contain the ports leading to both cylinders, that it performs
the double function of first admitting the steam to the high pressure
cylinder, cutting off the admission at the proper time to allow
expansion to take place there, and after high pressure piston has
reached the end of its stroke, passing on the steam to the low pressure
cylinder, where it is further expanded and exhausted in the usual
manner after its work is done.</p>

<p>The valve is specially designed with cavities so arranged as to
co-operate in increasing the area of opening to double the amount
obtainable with an ordinary valve having the same travel.</p>

<p>Without some special provision, the full power of the compound engine
cannot be exerted in starting, as the steam operates primarily on the
high pressure piston only, which has led to the condemnation of the
compound as a traction engine. This objection has been thoroughly
overcome in the Woolf by means of a “converting valve,” rendering it
possible to admit steam directly to the large or low pressure cylinder,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
thus largely increasing the power obtainable from the engine, even when
exerting its maximum power as a compound. This arrangement can be used
not only in starting, but also in cases of emergency, such as climbing
steep hills, getting out of bad places on the road, or disposing of an
especially tough cut in sawing, etc.</p>

<p>Without increasing the boiler pressure beyond that ordinarily used, the
compound engine gets fully one-third more force out of the steam used
than is at present obtainable with the simple engine as commonly worked.</p>

<p>In other words, the compound will show results compared favorably with
a good condensing simple stationary engine doing the same work.

<p>The heavy case iron base is cast in two sections, the rear part being
securely bolted to the front section. To the front section is also
bolted the main engine frame. This frame contains the bar guides for
the cross-head, and pillow block bearing for the double disc crank
shaft, and also forms the front head for the low pressure cylinder,
which is securely bolted to it.</p>

<p>The high pressure cylinder is attached to the low pressure cylinder by
two brackets securely bolted, and is supported by a pedestal, bolted
to the rear part of base. By this arrangement, both the high and low
pressure pistons are upon the same piston rod, which necessitates of
but one cross-head, connecting rod and crank.</p>

<p>The valve of the high pressure cylinder is operated and completely
under the control of the automatic shaft governor attached to one of
the band wheels, while the valve of the low pressure cylinder receives
its motion from a single eccentric on crank shaft at opposite side of
engine.</p>

<p>When engine is running, the steam enters the high pressure cylinder
first, and after performing its work there, exhausts through the
receiver pipe into the low pressure cylinder, and there exerts its
minimum force by expansion, and passes out to the condenser, if used,
or exhausts into the open air.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How would you change the water in a boiler
when steam is up?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By supplying more feed water and opening the
surface blow-off at short intervals.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. When blowing off a boiler, would you leave the
blow-off cock to attend to other work?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Never.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What would you do to relieve the pressure
on the boiler if the safety valve was stuck and steam constantly
rising?</p>

draught door and open damper in smoke box; work off the steam with the
engine and when boiler has cooled down put the safety valve in working
order.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What may be the result if you allow the water
in the boiler to get low?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Burning of the crown sheet and flues and
perhaps cause an explosion.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Would you turn feed water into a boiler in
which the water was very low?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Never, without first pulling the fire or
covering it with dry ashes and allowing the steam to go down.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. If you allow water in the boiler to get too
high what would be the result?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How would you stop foaming?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Close the throttle long enough to show the
true level of water. If the level of the water is sufficiently high,
feeding and blowing off will usually correct the difficulty.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What would you do if you discovered the water
gone from sight in the water glass?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Pull the fire or cover it over with dry ashes,

open or close any of the steam outlets.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q, What is a traction engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A traction engine is an engine the power of
which is transmitted to the driving or ground wheels by a combination
of gearing.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is an exhaust pipe?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The pipe through which the exhaust steam

<p class="neg-indent">A. A small cock used in check valves, pipes and
places where draining off water is necessary to prevent freezing.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is clearance in a steam cylinder?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It is the space between the cylinder head and
piston head when the latter is at end of the stroke.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is “cushion” in a steam cylinder?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Cushion is the compression of steam let in
through the lead of the valve in the clearance of the cylinder, and
is for the purpose of catching the weight of the piston and rod,
cross-head and connecting rod when the engine reaches the end of each
stroke. It also keeps the engine from pounding.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How much water would you blow off at any one
time while running?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Never blow off more than one gauge.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What are your general views regarding boiler
explosions?</p>

and divide the product by 33,000.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is meant by “brass bound”?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Brass bound means that the half brasses touch
each other and cannot be driven up any closer by the key.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How would you remedy a brass bound box on

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Does a perfect fitting or an imperfect fitting
valve have the most friction?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. An imperfect fitting one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How would you refit an imperfect fitting or
leaky valve?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It should be re-faced on a planer or filed and
scraped until it fits seat perfectly tight.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is a steam engine rated?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By amount of horse-power developed.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a foot-pound?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. One pound of force exerted through one foot of
space.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How many foot-pounds are required to lift 100
pounds one foot?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. One hundred.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How many foot-pounds required to lift one
pound 100 feet?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. One hundred.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. To lift 110 pounds through 300 feet how many
foot-pounds required?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. 300 × 110 = 33,000 foot-pounds.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Would that equal one horse-power?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, if done in one minute.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Suppose it took two minutes?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Then there would be only half a horse-power,
or 33,000 ÷ 2 = 16,500 foot-pounds per minute.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is it correct to say “horse-power per minute”
or “horse-power per hour”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No. When an engine is working at the rate of
10 horse-power, it is doing 10 horse-power all the time. It is an error
to assume that such an engine is doing 10 horse-power per minute, and
10 × 60 equals 600 horse-power per hour. When it is said that an engine
uses 20 pounds of steam per horse-power per hour, it is meant that this
amount of steam is used per hour for each horse-power developed.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is the foot-pounds of work done by a steam
engine, found?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Multiply the average pressure per square inch
during the stroke by the number of square inches in the piston, and by
the number of feet through which the piston has moved.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What do you understand by the “mean effective
pressure”?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The mean pressure is the average pressure
pushing the piston through the stroke, which is about one-third the
pressure in the boiler. There is generally some back pressure working
against it, therefore the “effective” pressure is only the difference
between the two. It can only be determined accurately by measurements
from an indicator diagram.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a single acting engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. An engine in which the steam acts on one side
of the piston only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How do you find the “piston’s speed”?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. On double acting engines, multiply the stroke
in inches by two and by the number of revolutions per minute and divide
by 12.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why multiply the stroke in inches by 2?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Because in double acting engines there are two
working strokes to each revolution.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why do you divide by 12?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. To reduce the inches to feet.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How is the “piston’s speed” of a single acting
engine found?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Multiply the stroke in inches by the
revolutions per minute and divide by 12.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the horse-power developed by an
engine, say 12&nbsp;×&nbsp;24 inch, running 125 revolutions per minute,
with 40 pounds mean effective pressure?</p>

<p class="neg-indent space-above1">A. Area = 12 × 12 × .7854 = 113.0976 sq. ins.</p>
<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">Piston speed = 24 × 2 × 125 ÷ 12 = 500 feet per minute.</li>

</ul>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a single valve engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It is an engine in which a single valve
controls the admission and distribution of steam to both ends of the
cylinder, or a common slide valve engine.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a four valve engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. An engine which has separate steam and exhaust
valves for each end both top and bottom of cylinder, such as a Corliss
engine.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Into what three classes are engines divided
with reference to the manner in which they are governed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Throttling engines, Automatic cut-off and
Governor engines.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is an Automatic cut-off engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. An engine in which the amount of steam
supplied is automatically cut off at various points in the stroke, in
accordance with the load and pressure. In Throttling engines the volume
admitted is constant and the pressure varied. In Automatic cut-off
engines, steam is admitted at the highest available pressure, and the
volume is varied to meet the requirements of the load. In Governor
engines, the steam is admitted and cut off by the governor.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a throttle governed engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. An engine in which the amount of steam
supplied is regulated by changing the pressure at which it enters the
cylinder in accordance with the variation of the load.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is a Governor engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. An engine in which the supply of steam is
regulated by the governor.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Into what classes may the Automatic cut-off
engine be divided?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Into two classes: The four valve engine, in
which the cut-off is usually effected by a detaching mechanism or trip
under the control of the governor; the single valve engine, in which
the point of cut-off is varied by changing the amount of travel of the
valve.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Give examples of the single valve type.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. High speed, self-contained engines which have
shaft governors.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What are their advantages?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. High rotative speed, compactness, portability,
light weight and simplicity.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Are they more economical than the four valve
engine?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. No; the four valve engines are the more
economical.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Give a prominent example of the four valve
engine.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The Reynold’s Corliss.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is meant by an engine running “over”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The top of the drive wheel running away from
the cylinder.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is meant by an engine running “under”?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The top of the drive wheel running towards the
cylinder.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Which way are engines generally run?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. “Over.”</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What advantages do engines have in running
“over”?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The pressure of the cross-head on engines
running over, is always downward upon the guides; for when the pressure
is on the head end of the piston, the pressure against the connecting
rod which is pointing upward, reacts by pressing the cross-head down
upon the lower guide, and when the pressure is on the crank end of the
cylinder, the cross-head will be dragging the crank, and as the crank
is below the center line, it will pull the cross-head down upon the
lower guide, while if the engine is running under, the pressure of the
cross-head will be upon the top guide, both on the outward and inward
strokes, and unless the cross-head is nicely adjusted to its guides and
the guides are perfectly parallel, the cross-head will be lifted when
subjected to thrust, and will fall on the center by its own weight,
causing the engine to pound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. At what point in the stroke is the pressure on
the cross-head greatest with a uniform pressure in the cylinder?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. When the crank is at right angles to the
guide.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How does the relative length of the connecting
rod affect this pressure?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The longer the connecting rod as compared with
the crank, the less will be the pressure on the guides.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the usual ratio of connecting rod to
crank?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The connecting rod is from four to six times
the length of the crank.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Are there any objections to a long connecting
rod?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. A long connecting rod makes a long engine, and
makes extra cost in the bed or frame and the room occupied. The longer
rod is heavier, and brings extra weight upon the cross-head, guides
and crank-pin. The long rod also lacks stiffness unless excessively
heavy.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What determines the length of the crank?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The stroke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What limits the stroke?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. The piston’s speed limits the length of stroke
allowable with a given rotative speed, or the number of revolutions per
minute with a given stroke.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the practical limit of piston’s
speed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Engines of from four to six foot stroke can
run at from seven to eight hundred feet piston’s speed per minute.
Those of shorter stroke should not run over six hundred feet.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why do high speed engines have a short stroke
in comparison with the diameter of their cylinders?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. So that they can run at a high rate of speed
without exceeding the limit of piston’s travel.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What is the office of the fly-wheel?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It maintains a uniformity of motion of the
crank, notwithstanding the unequal moving force upon the crank-pin.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Is the force upon the crank-pin unequal,
even when the pressure from the cylinder is uniform throughout the
stroke?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes. No matter what the pressure on the piston
is, it has no effect in turning the engine when the crank is in line
with the guides, which is termed “on the center.” As the crank gets
away from the centers, the effect of a given pressure becomes greater,
and reaches its maximum when the crank is nearly at right angles with
the guides.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. How does the fly-wheel counteract the jerky
motion of the crank which would result from this?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. By its tendency to resist an excessive moving
force, and by its momentum keeps the engine in motion when the moving
force is deficient.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What would you do if the cylinder gets worn or
cut from too tight rings or lack of oil?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Rebore the cylinder.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What would you do if the crank-pin heats, gets
worn or cut?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. If bent it should be turned true again; if not
bent it can be filed and polished perfectly true by hand.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What would you do if the main bearings
heat?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Loosen the caps and apply plenty of good oil.
If this does not stop it take off the caps, examine the oil holes to
ascertain why the oil does not reach the bearing. If the bearings have
become rough and cut, the shaft will have to be smoothed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Would any harm result from starting an engine
with the drip cocks closed?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Yes, the condensed steam filling the space
would smash the cylinder or piston head.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. What do you mean by atmospheric pressure?</p>

on the boiling point?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. It does.</p>

open, or partly open?</p>

<p class="neg-indent">A. Wide open on governor engines, as it is more
economical.</p>

steam is open to the atmosphere, it is a non-condensing engine.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Q. Why do you condense steam?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">RULES AND TABLES.</h2>
</div>

<p><i>To find the steam pressure</i> on slide valve, multiply the
unbalanced area of valve in inches by pounds pressure of steam per
square inch, add weight of valve in pounds, and multiply the sum by
0.15.</p>

<p><i>Safety boiler pressure</i> according to the United States Government
rule is as follows: Multiply ⅛ of the lowest tensile strength found
on any plate in the cylindrical shell by the thickness expressed in
inches or part of an inch of the thinnest plate in the same cylindrical
shell, and divide by the radius or half the diameter, also expressed
in inches, and the sum will be the pressure allowable per square inch
of surface for single riveting, to which add 20 per centum for double
riveting.</p>

<p><i>To find the water pressure</i> on steam pipes leading from boiler to
steam gauge, divide the difference in height between the highest point
of pipe and the center of steam gauge by 2³/₁₀; the result will be the
pressure exerted by the water in the pipe in pounds upon the gauge.</p>

<p><i>Area of a Circle.</i>—To find the area of a circle when the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
diameter is given, multiply the diameter by itself, or in other words
square the diameter and multiply the result by .7854.</p>

<p>Ex. Diameter 5 inches, 5 × 5 = 25 × .7854 = 29.635 area.</p>

<p><i>Circumference of a Circle.</i>—To find the circumference of a
circle when the diameter is given, multiply the diameter by 3.1416.</p>

<p>Ex. Diameter is 5 inches. 5 × 3.1416 = 15.708 inches circumference.</p>

<p><i>Diameter of a Circle.</i>—To find the diameter of a circle when the
circumference is given, multiply the circumference by .31831.</p>

<p>Ex. Circumference 20 inches. 20 × .31831 = 6.362 diameter.</p>

<p><i>To find the pressure</i> of pounds per square inch of a column
of water, multiply the height of the column in feet by .434.
Approximately, we generally call every foot elevation equal to one-half
pound pressure per inch, this allows for ordinary friction.</p>

<p><i>To find the diameter</i> of a pump cylinder to move a given quantity
of water per minute (100 feet of piston being the standard of speed),
divide the number of gallons by 4, then extract the square root and the
product will be the diameter in inches.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p><i>To find the horse-power</i> necessary to elevate water to a given
height, multiply the total weight of water in pounds by the height in
feet and divide the product by 33000 (an allowance of 25% should be
added for friction, etc.).</p>

<p><i>The area of the steam piston</i> multiplied by the steam pressure,
gives the total amount of pressure that can be exerted. The area of
the water piston multiplied by the pressure of water per square inch
gives the resistance. A margin must be made between the power and the
resistance to move the piston at the required speed—say 50%.</p>

<p><i>To find the capacity</i> of a cylinder in gallons, multiply the area
in inches by the height of stroke in inches, which gives the total
number of cubic inches; divide this amount by 231 (which is the cubic
contents of a gallon in inches), the product is the capacity in gallons.</p>

given, multiply the diameter of fly-wheel in inches by its number of
revolutions, and divide by the diameter of pulley in inches.</p>

<p>To find diameter of fly-wheel needed to drive a pulley at a given
number of revolutions, multiply the diameter of pulley in inches by
its number of revolutions, and divide by number of revolutions of the
engine.</p>

<p>To find revolutions of an engine with a given fly-wheel to drive a
pulley at a given number of revolutions, multiply the diameter of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
pulley in inches by its number of revolutions, and divide by the
diameter of fly-wheel in inches.</p>

<p>Rule for finding the amount of heating surface in a locomotive boiler:</p>

<p>Find surface of flues by multiplying the diameter by 3.14 to get
circumference, and multiply this product by the length of the flue,
then multiply this result by the number of flues in the boiler, and
divide by 144 to get number of square feet of surface in the flues.</p>

<p>Multiply length and width of fire box for number of square inches in
crown sheet, then multiply the length and height of the fire box and
the result by two, which gives the number of square inches in the
sides; then multiply the width and height and multiply the result by
two, which gives the number of square inches in the ends, from which
subtract number of square inches in space left for door and flues—then
add all these results together and divide by 144 to get the number
of square feet in the fire box. Add same to number of square feet of
flues, and the total will be the number of square feet in the boiler.</p>

<p>By dividing number of square feet by rated horse-power of boiler will
give number of square feet of heating surface to each horse-power.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
